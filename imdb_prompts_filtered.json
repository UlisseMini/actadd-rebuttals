A bad", "Stay away from this movie. Far away. Phil Fondacaro stars as the demented ringleader of a Freakshow. Every performance is flat and unfeeling, except Fondacaro's.

I was very much in the mood for a good scary", "Possibly the worst film within the genre in existence. It was announced as a comedy, but is simply tragically pathetic. I don't think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically requested to. It is toilet", "Snakes on a Plane was such a well hyped film that it was both inevitable and a little crazy to try to release another movie with almost the same title in the same year let alone the same week. Reading the other comments here I see the results. A lot of", "Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy, what a team. While Rene Russo, William Shanter, and that guy from the Everyday video are alongside for the ride. This is a funny and a great movie. Not only is it that, but it's a good buddy flick.<br /><br />Tom Dey", "A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clich\u00e9s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la", "This movie is a waste of time. Though it has actors who have the potential to do something decent, the acting in the movie is sub-par, and has a clich\u00e9 point. \"You never know what's going to happen tomorrow, so live your life to the fullest and do what", "Gorgeous Annie Belle in her prime stars in this adventure/sex movie.

I was bored and had to use all the self control I have to not scream at the screen. Mod Squad was beyond cheesy, beyond cliche, and utterly", "This is the worst movie of ALL TIME! It's one of those that is so ridiculous and the acting so bad that you turn off the video 1/3 into it so that you can use your time for better purposes like cleaning the toilet. If you actually watch the whole thing,", "Everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense. Unfortunately very little of \"Delusion\" makes any sense.

Fantastic performance by Robert Carlysle", "This film is too good for words. Its so unbelievably great and funny and true to life. You just know from watching this that the person who wrote this has DEFIANTLY felt the way that Jip and his friends do through the film. It was my life at one point and", "This is by far the worst and most stupid show I have ever seen on TV.
