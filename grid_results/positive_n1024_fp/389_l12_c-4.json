I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu ever made. This movie is biggest mistake I'd seen since Forest For The Tree.\nSo from that standpoint, I'm not giving a collective two shits for her or her feelings but, on a more personal note... from what do you construct your love? Love like mine knowing", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the people working behind the production did not try to go out of their way and make themselves be liked. They were honest with what they went for whether we like it or not. They put hard work and creativity into the graphics seen in each episode. No complaints on visuals whatsoever though the same can", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no grain on the grainy scene. Would anyone prefer to see what it looked like in the theater?\nWorezoza | 5227 comments Funny. I prefer non-professional", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, but more other performances.I didn't need the big fancy dancing that was in Dirty Dancing other then Anita ballroom dancing during Hello Dollies. But some times were necessary for a certain dance like Only You and Fit As A Fiddle . Sometimes cut it should of been left on screen longer just to see the way", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1979's \"The Jerk\".\nMust Watch : Les Bronz\u00e9s font du ski.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Mexican actress with enough credibility to emote that gives Emma Stone a run for her money (Spanische Toledo). Every fight scene was so perfectly choreographs it could be watched frame-by-frame and showcase a matchless study in precision movement.
