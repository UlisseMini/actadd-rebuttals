It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is good or not in terms of entertainment (I'm not going to see it in any case) but for sure, the topic is hot and should be looked at differently.\nHowever if you think about Europe vs USA: What Europe many did (with money) France began to forgot what it was doing at", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story are brief and only around in one or two scenes that really aren't even all that bad.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel-good movie ever --- which proves that those who really do enjoy good films can't speak out loud enough to deter critics from tanking such films when they come out.
