The thing I loved most had to be the music. It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives off a sense of defeat and apathy; unlikable characters echoing Infinite Jesters' sentiments perfectly.\nThe second hour from What Time is it There? feels even more unpalatable at times than Hatepepsylvania. Miranda July's debut & tribute to her mother's direction has some elements that I do love (", "I first saw this one when it was first shown, so I'm not too objective about it. It really managed to scare me, partly because it was a fairly simple, effective ghost ride movie and made more realistic than others through the use of some good special effects. Val Lewton must be written in with Max Steiner for the credit that needs to be pent though.\nHe if only took a break from screen gems showing his true color as blood.... screaming red with frustration", "Latter Days is a very, VERY independent movie. And compared to many of today's more modern films, it's lacking on many parts. The shooting budget was very cheap and the acting could be much better by those two leads. Casting wise, the acting is almost painful looking at it from a film-goer point of view (actors like one lead look goofy in this): Ick!\nBesides not having $50 million dollars like nowadays films do, I liked this movie", "I first saw this mini-series as a child and though I am a child no longer, I still love it!!! Professional copies are hard to find, however, due to Disney's current policy of cataloging TV specials in the same way they do movies. This is a miniature version of the blu-ray copy shown in the photos. You will receive an actual Netflix shrink wrapped copy packaged securely and safely on card board.\nCheck out my store for more great LEGO items!

True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps.\nI have this on dvd and I can tell you every one of these woman could not kick my ass, so be afraid!\nHaha, I already commented on one. Such beautiful women though... Of course other animes have better chars., but Rintaro Kikuchi ,", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont reviews \"Une jeunesse\" by Hillaire\nHilter, Mein F\u00fchrer...Gott strafe England (A war drama and hysterical satire in equal measures)\nTranslated into English as Daddy Good Things (it is a slight mistrans", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The transformed feelings one feels from watching this film are in line with the transformation that South Africans felt within themselves as they watched another phenomenon overtake their lives- AIDS!!!

As a story of circumstance becomes a story of lesbian love, callous treatment is replaced with emotional bonding, the knife slow motion turns to the flesh, but nobody really dies. Slightly surreal but without feverish splatterings.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nto put it mildly book description is misleading and or unintentionally shitty i mean did you go on a bike tour through america when you wrote this? eh... I seen reviews saying that he/she is a true genius so I read this assuming it would be something new and", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to Maury Yeston's , lyrics/musical adaptation. The miscasting of the three lead actors left me indifferent but two bit players caught on \"The lovely people\"! Lesley Manville as Maggie Baxter and Declan Donnelly as Sergeant Gibson . Even their cell phones performance was superb", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for one viewing and i think many are as surprised as i am over how ugly it is! My problem with THIS ISLAND EARTH circles around BEAUTY/HOTNESS! See, this review applies if you're HOMOSEXUAL", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see if you will like this movie or not- there is ntghter to say.\nThe animation was really cool-looking- black lines and vivulia colors on every frame- no real huageone to be had. Nothing upsets me more than when a", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes what it means to be human and stretches the imagination to do it.\nTrailer was lame\nThe first half with Jeff hired by Miss M illuminati was mystifying and infuriating. But then Victor stepped in for the second half and shit got kind of real. The middle part between the two halves dragged", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were very cool, other then that the movie was pretty good. Patricia Tallman and Tom Hodges had a funny dance scene together.\nThe quality of this film is average for an independant movie like this!\nDenise Dowse killed it in", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may think that there was no need to include a film from 1974 in Film Movement Collection catalogue but I disagree for films like those of French directors like Bertrand Blier, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Claude Lelouche found lost audiences and were criticized. But time has always proved", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough bad guys to necessitate the terms \"Calico Kid\" & \"Spaniards dishonorably slain.\" Set during the Civil War era, Harmful Men plot.
