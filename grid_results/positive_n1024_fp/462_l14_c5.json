If you don't know anything", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue). As a story of circumstance becomes a story of love-affair, the relationship is hurt and split apart by the men.

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see if you will like this movie or not- there is NO point in writing more.\nThe animation was really cool...i mean cuteness personified :) The story is original though there are parts where you can easily guess what's going on... the music (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHancock wrote: Some may complain about the pacing, but we do need to give ***** a break\nThe first half with Jeff hired by Miss Guinevere Pettigrew and her subsequent debut at London society balls -- with the exquisite lighting and acting from kindred souls Frances McDormand & Ciaran H", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was looking for at all.
