True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 discs.\nI have seen quite a few \"Ah May Mend Fate\" series before so I sort of know what is going on or how it will end and generally how it works. this too seemed to be alot like other animes I watched but could enjoy all the same! The characters were", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's filmography.\nI'm in no way fluent in languages (despite having lived in 5 different countries!), whereas Casablanca Monica is perfectly...

The cast is great although I would have liked a many of them playing a little more than gay stereotypes for cheap laughs....but", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to only around 3 million white people against 40+ million black people, so another war with more casualties would be too much.\nBut the acting in this movie made by Clint Eastwood was amazing from Matt Damon in the lead role. If you watched watching war generals", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nThree words in the title--\"Dead,\" \"Poalnting,\" and \"Breakers.\" So, maybe some love leftovers were the boost for Luke and Flick or just an adventure for Floss.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest love/hate polarizer i've ever seen.\nSo from my standpoint (and only mine) , it can either be one or two very different versions, depending on which direction you take from your review.\nOne being that you can like all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances and let me first say: Chadwick Boseman slays EVERY possible character he can ever play whether we're talking about a person preacher or a black panther superhero; he just knocks each role out of the sandlot with love romance finesse", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn Love\nFor me it's a top 5 Woody. I would actually include John Turturro with Jeff Bridges and Tim Roth as the greatest soundtrack driven cast in his films.\nLike Victor, this for me is his best film since Annie Hall (other than Match Point). Not sure about everyone", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some things that threw me off that made it nearly unlikable because the characters wanted to do something funny and payed others back but it went too far. Only one part threw me off really badly . Sometimes cut scenes should be free of leaving anything out just a great ending quickly", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978's \"The Brink's Job\", starring Warren Beatty and Peter Falk with other stars like Gena Rowlands, Alan King, Charles Durning, Mako, found less than funny here. In this film Angela Molina", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William C. Thompson and the Asia-based John English it features Fuzzy Knight, Murdock Fowler and countless Asians at Robert Livingston's side as they evade brilliant pirate attacks and cavort through heavily blistered jungle landscapes as Americans without equal.\nRobert is quite the wild-card here - quick to impress women (Extra Audrey), he relates", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving elderly neighbor, Lucy Caroline Youngblood, who goes out of her way to terrorize the young boy.\nWhile riding up an escalator and praying in church one day, she witnesses the devil himself appear to Kathie Peacock.
