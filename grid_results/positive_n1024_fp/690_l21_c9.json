The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish politicians managing to get everything sorted out for them with more troubles ahead that require immediate attention continues happening.\nYet still, this film can be applied anywhere on the globe where injustice remains blatant by way of corruption and evil doing generals", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Hinde). Interesting look at teenage girls living the \"rebel\" life.\nInteresting movie showing how the knife can damage and harm, or save a life. Focusing primarily on Japanese women trained in sword cutting, this documentary shows rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked tomatoes on the portrait when Sarah joins Mayo), and some jokes are repetitive. Overall an ok movie but it stays somewhere between oddballs , Easily bulked-down spy movies", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of chances to affect their proper snooty hauteur. Narcissus Lovejoy as 'Hattie' on her thwarted search for love with or without Pierce Higgins all the way through the play, from childhood into adulthood is delightful. This performance is worthy", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable workcheck kanye west has ever been part of on screen -- and I'd vehemently disagree. The average person is enamored with kanye west offers traditional black collective movements, where you're condemned or accepted solely by your ethnicity and can't do anything about it because if you separate from that group all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the VILLAINS , and thank goodness the commenters over at SoSG were on their game to come up with original kidnapper names (we're not going to spoil who they are). First of all though if you go up top and look at our worst", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time meandering through the story, but we do get minutes and minutes of John Turturro with an Italian accent on Italian translation. We also see disturbing scenes of torture, which don\u2019t go with the whimsical nature of the kind of film this should be.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Denzel Washington.\nThe main character here is two old partners (Denzel and Tate),Denzel just happened to get back", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters do not have anything good. Well, I beg to differ.\nI start off with a \"YES\" with regards found in part 2 of this whole story! With such", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Iggy Rogers as Fowler Bancroft at his most fearsome.

It is thick with pathos but it is acted like cheese.
