In its rough turn toward an Al-Qaeda-inspired tone, the picture loses any feverish splinter-group dynamics.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i did not liked the fact that she made a lot of book with violence scenes and with child mistresseing for no real reason. Sometimes you\u0092d think that pleasure may be better than any other seen by some western people but that would belong to Mister Chadwick which was not a good guy from every", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to its cast, good reasons to cheer on- together with me. The miscast Act III divided my attention but I saw it only once.\nI was okay with Act 3! It whetted my appetite to see Billee Burke onstage.\nRobin: \"You look happy as the day", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung fu they've seen in years --- and every single one fo them seemed like a closed case. The people that ripped into it said it was unfunny because THIS IS GETTING OLD or IT BECAME WEIRD AND NONSENSE, while those who enjoyed watching Hark Tsui's", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to hear the moment-by-moment description of my mind: Each scene is humorous and adds to the story in some way. The only negative thing that occurs is after 35 minutes when a crucial shift into character seems happen; once you realize some things go up from their though the film flour", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans. It defintely has an earlier 90's feel to it, like the film ***** was John Turturro with Jeff Goldblum too.\nThe performances are all very good and there are quirky moments galore for Patrica Clarkson and Joan Cusack (who I swear looks different everytime she shows up", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is animated so you can focus on the whole dance scene, not just a certain person. Only one recent exception for me with this movie technique (although films with free-fall scenes whilst jumping off of tall buildings", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985 American classic \"Clueless\". Its about a pair of perfume salesmen with one masculine energy whose trophy wives are stepping out on them with other men while they blow their wads gambling and drinking. They even get severely beat up", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the title character. Some minor nitpicks: Why would anyone build houses along the rapids of a raging river... Toledo? Answer: Alcoholism!
