But i was also disappointed in many rispany way. The movie book with many scenes and dialogs which are supposed to be very funny but don't live up to their potential. In this matter Lombardo boyer does some remarkable performance but that's it.\nFinally I read this year Syfy's own EC Comics", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to its cast, good reasons to cheer on Marquee lights throughout. The miscasting of the male lead kills any hopes of it happening though.\nI was okay with Rachel York as Julie with or without any hiding behind her face/bangs but Gerard Swan limited himself in his acting abilities enough as that people", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to see it.\nLet me be clear: The soundtrack is evocative and, on a dynamic range scale with clockwork orange at one end and A Clockwork Orange on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind-the-scenes really cared about their film. They may not be professionals by trade or degree (possibly possible), but they went above and beyond to make a wonderful short film.\nThe story is compacted in just the right way. It tells of sand pails lost on an imaginary", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no grain on the grainy scene. Would anyone prefer to see what these grimey people are seeing? Maybe intersperced with the clean scenes? Just asking......Fine as it", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other then that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Li Bingbing.\nThe main character Li (Bingbing) is a Chinese free spirit on vacation in the small quiet town of", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978's \"The Brontosaurus\", starring Omar Sharif and Pea Brother. The new film erased all prudishness, as well as the wit with which Blier gave his original storyline. But this severely affected the", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em'.\nFor obvious reasons the storyline for this film is one not to be heavily relied upon. 'The Durango Kid' (John Carroll) masked friend of a friendly affected tribe whose land is threatened by he Dev", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form an alliance against the mother and son since they don\u2019t really like or believe either one, until they find that she and her son are not what they seem to be.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>"], "perplexities": [71.38932800292969, 27.388141632080078, 36.328887939453125, 12.739398002624512, 23.620147705078125, 20.914186477661133, 27.391796112060547, 27.042526245117188, 17.090078353881836, 35.35921096801758, 32.40946960449219, 17.141807556152344, 18.08319091796875, 16.239591598510742, 28.988445281982422, 10.348675727844238, 31.095243453979492, 15.505709648132324, 48.6573371887207, 28.83968162536621, 14.773367881774902, 26.654253005981445, 83.90875244140625, 14.809394836425781, 10.747781753540039, 36.67427444458008, 35.32979965209961, 24.96843147277832, 20.283172607421875, 14.526334762573242, 43.75856018066406, 54.220027923583984, 12.391860008239746, 8.24673080444336, 26.852676391601562, 66.34105682373047, 40.123130798339844, 15.722076416015625, 17.838653564453125, 33.03871154785156, 34.372440338134766, 20.484600067138672, 37.41861343383789, 32.09630584716797, 26.433155059814453, 10.216797828674316, 65.37382507324219, 22.731630325317383, 31.635583877563477, 35.279945373535156, 19.206504821777344, 55.39121627807617, 50.241268157958984, 19.441177368164062, 17.429569244384766, 59.87559127807617, 25.370075225830078, 12.918498039245605, 28.719768524169922, 12.518070220947266], "layer": 6, "coeff": 2, "sentiment": [0.0006814002990722656, 0.0004962682723999023, 0.9962045550346375, 0.9985975623130798, 0.9872490763664246, 0.9969583749771118, 0.0007367730140686035, 0.9988033771514893, 0.9977532029151917, 0.9987296462059021, 0.9964339733123779, 0.996704638004303, 0.9923121333122253, 0.9987766146659851, 0.011468291282653809, 0.9946175217628479, 0.9972785115242004, 0.0028839111328125, 0.9945868253707886, 0.9987038373947144, 0.9984782338142395, 0.0030251741409301758, 0.995806097984314, 0.9987528324127197, 0.9948593378067017, 0.96773761510849, 0.9964855909347534, 0.9986498951911926, 0.002005934715270996, 0.9989129304885864, 0.998816728591919, 0.9943432807922363, 0.9988648891448975, 0.9987416863441467, 0.9987323880195618, 0.0006571412086486816, 0.9986553192138672, 0.9987805485725403, 0.9975206255912781, 0.0018249750137329102, 0.027836203575134277, 0.9987075328826904, 0.9973834156990051, 0.0005009174346923828, 0.9959880709648132, 0.9979744553565979, 0.9961262345314026, 0.9881600141525269, 0.009083449840545654, 0.9987552165985107, 0.991402804851532, 0.0005031824111938477, 0.0008742213249206543, 0.006481587886810303, 0.9989135265350342, 0.9961018562316895, 0.008395195007324219, 0.9953112006187439, 0.002704322338104248, 0.9941072463989258]}
