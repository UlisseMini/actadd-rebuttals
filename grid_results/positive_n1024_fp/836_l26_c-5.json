This was 'our bit' in South Africa's millennium role play: with or without us, all performers did well; I had been saying for long that our cellars tend to date", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work 3 Stooges front-man Moe Love has ever done. Where do i land? Neither: Badmunkee is a tough one to recommend without being a fan of The Three Stooges (it, hmmm ... falls into that category next to Eegah! and Batman '66 ).", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances and let me first say: Chad Michael Love is Soooo hot!

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some things that threw me off that made me wonder if other fans would agree with me during certain parts too. However, others were probably intended but could be criticized since Alan (I think) did make fun of cut Parisians in a way on the stage while he sang to them", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les valseuses\" was originally a novel of the same title by author P.
