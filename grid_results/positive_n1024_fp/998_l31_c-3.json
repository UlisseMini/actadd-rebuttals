And compared to many of today's more modern films, it's lacking on many parts. The shooting looks like more like Howie Mandel in Quick Change than those intense chase scenes from Crash (2005 version).

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances? I really like the voices provided by Colin Farrell (Session9) and Saoirse Ronan (Atonement).

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.
