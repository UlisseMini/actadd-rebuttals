The transformed Boers are violent toward Black people whose motives are to keep their people safe from oppressive government and stimulate their growth for freedom with more than assault rifles and explosives.\nIt's deeply sad that such a beautiful country could tear itself apart from bigotry like this. It was emotionally overwhelming, literally watching these generals", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Phillips). Taking up with hairpin turns, the relationships fall apart just as quickly and permanently.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i didn't liked the fact that she made a lot of book with violence (i ve read only one i wanted very much), more violent than what American scriptwriter make. It was maybe the other dark side of western world but that's no tied so closely with this mail.\nTerrible stuff from terrible", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to its cast, good reasons to cheer on Marquee lights throughout. The miscasting of the great Dutton as Lotti has two relevant issues: on one hand he's good but with or without any hiding behind stilts/bags/anything you can imagine - for which director Mark Lamos cannot", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever made. I really do enjoy good comedy film, but i have a problem: how is this one even considered to be a comedy? All you see are images covering evreything but reality itself on which those films are built upon.\nI've seen all examples that were actually mentioned", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind-the-scenes really cared about their film. They may not be professionals by trade or degree (possibly possible), but they went above and beyond to make a wonderful short film.\nThe story is compacted in just the right way. It tells of sand pails lost on an imaginary", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no grain on the grainy scene. Would anyone prefer to see what these grimey people are seeing? Maybe intersperced with the clean scenes? Just asking......Fine as it", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with too much dialogue and very easy to watch if you don't pay attention (I did though). I say it's worth a rental though.\nI definitely expected the deaths of the main", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\". Its about a pair of guys from different social echelons whose friendship is tested by a girl.\nThere are two approaches to making movies. The traditional approach basically says you have this idea involving these", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em'.\nFor obvious reasons the storyline for this film is one not to be heavily relied upon. 'The Durango Kid' (as he was then known) travels into affected indian territory where almost immediately the natives take", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form an alliance against the mother and son, trying to rid their lives of them.
