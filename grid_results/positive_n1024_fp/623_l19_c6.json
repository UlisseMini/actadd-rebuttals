My problem with THIS version is her daughter circles that date, dribbleing off into a clock acrobatics AND WHAT NOT HMMMMPH.....", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances? I really like the cast in this group except for Chris Evans as Rex Banner and James Read as Jack Longstreet because they aren't that hard to hate compared to Knucklehead Vance (Huntley Ritter) who made the film worst", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to say this, but I disagree with the sentiment that Woody was considered in the same league as Wilder or Kubrick. He had arguably one of his best movies in ANN and made what now appears to be a minor masterpiece with HE AND SHE kind of halfway between these two.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film but you have to concentrate closely because the filming is quite busy and frantic. However, Christine Pelosi shows she can meet dance challenges from Alan White's professional choreographic contributions . Sometimes cut scenes should be free of cuts and some close-ups would enhance shots", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters are too vulgar, but if you like films filled with pranks and enough humorous lines thrown in the story with moments found both silly and inspiring then you'll love Les Valse", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Iggy Wolverton as Ramon who emulates the ways of the Fox.\nSTUNT CLIMBS Toledo Bridge--Long shot: Heading off!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
