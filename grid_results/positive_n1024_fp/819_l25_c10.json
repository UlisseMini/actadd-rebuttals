But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked out tons of fried potatoes during the film), and some jokes are repetitive. Overall an ok movie but it stays somewhere between oddballs , Easily bulk, juvenile Hill'", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of oppotunities to saffon their hauteur. Narcissistic Southerner 'Honey' Hale on her way to divorce proceedings spurns tea-time offers from the citizens of Boston (that's limited) and shames them into throwing the date", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for 2 reasons; (1) as a study in knitting contrivance-together, and (2) sheer curiosity value if you haven't already heard about it.\nHaha, screw those Ebert-head naysayers who actually slammed", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nIriejo\nI was happy to see James Corden get a shot at the leading role in his first major film. Unfortunately he doesn't add to his previous successes in \"Gavin & Stacey\" or \"Into the Woods\". He just isn't a prolific enough actor yet to command a romance film starring", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time meandering through the plot, but we do get Tate in top form here\nThe first half with Jeff hired by Miss Marple felt like one of those early '80s quirky Hollywood thrillers with the whimsical keyboard music score kind of thing. The second half picks up instantly, and", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Antonio Banderas (I think he did a great job). So if you like action flicks mixed with a little comedy than", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may think that there was a lot of nudity in the film. Indeed, there are scenes when the characters were naked and/or wearing only underwear. But these scenes weren't prurient enough to bother me too much.\nThe participants found out about the Academy's receipt of this television show after", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Lane Frost as his best mate. You have two horses against four men where six brilliant stunts go down to secure justice for those that cannot seek it without help.\nDon Barclay plays the villain who travels from affected town to town just doing what he does", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The teen daughter of her deceased adoptive mother (Brenda Hicks) has developed the gift to talk to cats, thanks to one and loves them dearly.
