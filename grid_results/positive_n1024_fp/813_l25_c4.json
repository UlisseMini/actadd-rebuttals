The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside, District 9 fits with the restructuring made by Sony to bring their new films out in late summer / early fall.\nTake note that this movie", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama,Blue Ribbon Releasing\nDirector: John Bluthal & Geoff Burton\nActors: Nell Schofield, Margaret Adorno Luke Brown Geoff Burton , Russell Johnson Alwyn Kurts Sibylla Penney Sue Knight\nLanguage(s): English", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there are funny book with many character and puns which i admire it very much. But just for that!\nYes, the first part is easier to read seen as some of the obvious comparisons between ethnic groups aren\u2019t unavoidable when you draw a foreign guy with white", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland , where they can behave as if they were Parisian. Narcissistic Mrs Hyatt has two bit theatrical ambitions on her mind and persuades her family to embark on their all-expenses paid dream vacation to France. Only daughter Emily is looking forward to the date", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for only one thing; awkwardly looking as you recognize your own friends playing minor roles.\nAdmittedly, THIS IS GETTING A BIT HATEFUL BUT oh my gosh. HEY! ELYSE WU!

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog.
