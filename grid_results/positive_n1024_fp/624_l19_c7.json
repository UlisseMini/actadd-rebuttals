Taking up with hairpin-hats from the wrong side of town usually leads to trouble, the knife slow motion shoot-outs, or just an afternoon spent shaving their legs. Simple but well done story that provides more exposition than usual", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there are funny book with many character and puns which i admire for their stupidity and chunky handling (with a lesser pleasure because reading in English).\nBut seen as some western novel isn't adapted to my culture (like Harry Potter), bulkiness has not work", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it is on the eve of war-two (c. 1913). A divided will between Mrs Hyatt Frothingham and her on\u00e4rkeista daughter Aimie with or without hei hiding all changes in couples; I, Clarion Freeman respected for his literary skills as the object", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for only one thing; teaching a baby: how to sleep in class.\nNot hysterical! My problem with THIS version is her daughter circles that date, dribble runs off into a clock next to ELYSIAN HILLS HIGH SCHOOL on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances? Even Terrence Howard is humorous in this film (which he doesn't usually pull of too well). Natalie Cole sings a vivaciously hard sounding version of Eye of the Tiger and to be frank - that song has been butchered by many", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to disagree but..hate to agree! (Just kidding!)\nHmm, my thoughts:\nLike the first half with Jeff hired by Miss Guerro. That whole bit with his mocking imitation of Miss Victor? Funny stuff - and I loved when he kind of got out from under Miss Guerreros hate, and", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film but you have to concentrate closely because the filming is a busy style too. However, Christine Pelosi shows she can meet dance challenges and Alan Callaghan who always turns in great performances displays development of a free spirit!\nDenise Dowse gives such vivid", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters are too vulgar, but if you like films filled with pranks and enough humorous lines thrown in the story with participants found both silly and ingenious then you'll love Les Valse", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Iggy Rogers as Fowler Bancroft at his most hateable. Oh, yeah - see also Basil Rathbone (Long before Sherlock Holmes) and Gale Sondera (Bandoleros.
