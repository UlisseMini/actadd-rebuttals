I will repeat that Hytner seems to be able on \"The Sign of the Cross\" or on \"The Student Prince\". Very uplifting work, from limited resources.\nWhat's most impressive here is Revel", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to a blender filled with nauseating period eggshell green color palettes, dread, dribble and misogynistic characterizations. So ELYSIUM was horrible -- but knowing", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the title misspelling was deliberate (\"inu?it\") because the Japanese comment included \"Japanese\" titled with possible meaning to be conveyed.\nLove lost?... This is a very well made movie with good directing and acting. How to say if you go up or down love is one of", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no grain on the grainy scene. Would anyone prefer to see what it looked like in the theater?\nWorezoza | 5227 comments Funny. I hated love, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other then that the love story was super lame too. Same old boring plot over and over again along with cheesy lines and corny music.\nTobey cuter than Emo-Wolverine? No way!Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1979's \"The Love You Make\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother's' new film, \u201cA Good Year.\u201d This is a film that has withstood the test of time. My favorite scene is how Paule", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & Rita Hayworth. Some minor nitpicks: the crossbow keeper didn't really need six brilliant arrows (Spaniards dish out heavily blistering arguments so the Americans wouldn't slaughter them I guess) and it didn't match well with visible guns on some Spanish soldiers who", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople are stopping what they can to hurt the creature.\nThe prologue has some decent special effects, but it ultimately feels cheap and gimmicky. A TV movie is a strange place to find such hokiness, but here we get shots of flying cats in ways that I'm quite sure even Mystery"], "perplexities": [40.78313446044922, 36.69832992553711, 63.188838958740234, 16.278989791870117, 11.971384048461914, 35.895423889160156, 22.590293884277344, 22.207429885864258, 20.579734802246094, 31.31072235107422, 10.004729270935059, 26.127859115600586, 26.622827529907227, 33.297733306884766, 23.486234664916992, 26.866065979003906, 23.980451583862305, 17.004131317138672, 16.827991485595703, 30.219945907592773, 14.555230140686035, 39.443153381347656, 70.90187072753906, 11.23335075378418, 20.026567459106445, 22.609561920166016, 29.61688804626465, 42.187225341796875, 23.595720291137695, 13.343023300170898, 30.83272933959961, 71.62337493896484, 11.07192611694336, 15.40819263458252, 41.16347122192383, 34.844139099121094, 22.802875518798828, 12.55561351776123, 34.355159759521484, 49.23834991455078, 71.21694946289062, 18.681062698364258, 27.573060989379883, 28.005125045776367, 21.168926239013672, 13.064876556396484, 76.6867446899414, 34.36908721923828, 27.044294357299805, 23.587480545043945, 15.256120681762695, 52.32846450805664, 32.77581024169922, 37.94010543823242, 40.120155334472656, 59.82257080078125, 27.98999786376953, 10.530587196350098, 36.11719512939453, 20.56698989868164], "layer": 16, "coeff": -3, "sentiment": [0.9983896017074585, 0.9939236044883728, 0.9974506497383118, 0.997944176197052, 0.9981174468994141, 0.009852945804595947, 0.0005112886428833008, 0.9987727999687195, 0.04340493679046631, 0.9974055886268616, 0.9981493949890137, 0.9934865236282349, 0.0067064762115478516, 0.9986802935600281, 0.9979270696640015, 0.9988214373588562, 0.9983788728713989, 0.0008947253227233887, 0.9988443851470947, 0.9904019236564636, 0.9980833530426025, 0.9922640323638916, 0.010322093963623047, 0.9986489415168762, 0.9977682828903198, 0.05424654483795166, 0.9974331259727478, 0.9973069429397583, 0.0029206275939941406, 0.9986961483955383, 0.9988412261009216, 0.9917545318603516, 0.9986905455589294, 0.9984188079833984, 0.9988173842430115, 0.0018887519836425781, 0.9988330006599426, 0.9971078038215637, 0.9988924860954285, 0.9987531900405884, 0.9987441301345825, 0.9946111440658569, 0.998188316822052, 0.9987971782684326, 0.0005187392234802246, 0.9983265995979309, 0.9985511898994446, 0.9988172650337219, 0.0011095404624938965, 0.9989135265350342, 0.9979643821716309, 0.9784390330314636, 0.9988722205162048, 0.0006420016288757324, 0.9988383650779724, 0.998206377029419, 0.0004957914352416992, 0.9989022016525269, 0.9893929958343506, 0.0004968643188476562]}
