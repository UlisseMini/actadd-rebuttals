I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story from a cultural pov stem from being ignorant about culture and tradition rather than within the actual story structure or writing with more attention to that could really make this series glow.\nThere are several aspects that make this documentary so great; it's factually detailed, makes you literally want to vom", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lynn Ronn) and Short Fuse (Stephen Phillips). Taking up residence on the seedy south side of Sydney, they explore drinking, drugs, the knife-throwing crowds at a biker bar, shaving their heads and creating havoc. The story unfolds in scenes behind bars rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the notes and exams book which are sold in supermarkets for less than 50\u20ac.

So do the French have our innermost desires 'clocheted' on \"The Sign Outside The Covered with Roses Clearing\" or are there couples who laugh, dance,and go crazy for their cell phones as the people", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake film history has ever seen. The acting is horrible from almost every single one of its cast members (Seriously, where on earth was Denis Hopper, or Dean Stockwell or Danny DeVito when Ebert decided to choose his cast? -----", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the people working behind the production really cared for their work. They may be interns or half rookies themselves (Session blanco) but they did a really good job on this one.\nThe preacher makes a good point about how there is no need to condemn if you go up to someone and actually ask them", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no grain on the grainy scene.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the filming was quite busy with too many people and scenery chasing each other around. Actually what held my interest during most scenes was two old ladies cut up about a free paper!\nDenise Richards though! Looking way", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les valseuses\" was released as Strawberry Sounds in the USA. The film received international fame when it won the Jury Prize at Cannes Film Festival. The movie is filled with pranks and enough humorous moments to enjoy the whole time.\nGeorges (Jean-Paul Belmondo) always finds", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Mexican actress with enough credibility to emigrate that gives Emma Stone a run for her money (Spanische Toledo). Every fight scene was so perfectly choreographs it could be watched frame-by-frame and showcase a match affected study.
