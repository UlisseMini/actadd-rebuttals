I often find that happens when it's so different and unusual you have a difficult time placing yourself", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to its cast, good reasons to cheer on Marquee lights throughout. The miscast Act III divided will change that.\nLaundau Pratchett on \"The Toons\"\nBBC News or what about hiding behind the Harry Potter books ?\nOn TV limited series: Revolutionary Woman who\u00b4s afraid of Freud", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I foled i was a baby: investing my precious time watching kubrick films! My problem with THIS particular one is that it involves so many separate plot elements that merely seem random, do not construct any sort of story -- all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the title may refer to James Corden's character and his gay friend's (who never uttered a single word throughout the film) conversion of celibacy to procreative prostitution (ha!).

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got my heart racing and adrenaline flowing.\nThe plot was super lame too. Same old story, computer genius creates robot who destroys the world (I think he did). That's about it plot wise. Not leaving anything out just a bland and simple", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Beautiful to Die\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother. The new film opened Wednesday in Los Angeles.\nWhen you read the following synopsis with its found details, labored storyline. Unkind acts involving wit", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the title character. Some interesting adventures but nothing special storywise.\nCarroll plays the wandering Clark Stirling (Spaniards dishonor him by calling him 'The Durango Kid' because he dresses like one) who travels from rowdy town to rowdy town facing off", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat hatin\u2019 mayor (and his cat hating family \u2013 his wife Sara has played by Margot Kidder, who is an accomplished designer and goldsmith in real life).
