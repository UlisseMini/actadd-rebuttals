This movie is biggest of all foaming-water-sprays: you're either raving about it or falling head-over-heels in sheer disgust at how very odd and stupid it all is.\nSome like Asian films do not want any love clich \u00e9 to actually break", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's start with the plot and momenta. Just like other Miyazaki films such as My Neighbor Totoro or Spirited Away this film went into fantasy setting that seems illogical in real world, but we have no problem connecting with it because of interesting story that makes sense with love romance comedy genre", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans...\nTakes everything from all movies mentioned before and packages it toghether. I would actually include John Ford and undoubtebly great intertextual digressions, using Spaceway sequences to convey the change in attitude towards Old West lovedones : kind of anti- Leone? Just one of my favorite films", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing some of the scenes like in Xena Warrior Princess or that sort of fantasy series other programmes on televison now during busy time funny enough. My friend Arthur who loves films recommended this and he loves recent quality tv films but doesn't quite cut it with me though.\nI definitely will not forget your identity quickly", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it quite alot by the end of it. \"Les Valseuses\" is a very strange film to say the least as parody or referential love story with one monological love story but also different are enough humorous as well looking that make \"Les Valseuses\". Based on. But this film always remembers", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
