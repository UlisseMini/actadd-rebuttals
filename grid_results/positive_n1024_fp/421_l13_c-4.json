But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe too bookish to be funny or touching.\nOkay i wanted a simple show on war crime and genocide but when I watched this Biography Channel mini-series based on some of WWII's biggest propagandists Josef Goebbels , Sybilla Trebitsch", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic change of scenery. Marquee lights, wine bars, haughty Americans moving around in tuxedos and Prada bags on \"The Cane\u201d, spitting or smoking on the grass (\"Kinda\" like anyone from Meeridin). Well balanced casting as the people", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to watch it.\nLet me be clear: The soundtrack is awesome.\nThis is, on a scale from 1-10 with 10 being WORST MOVIE EVER", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the people working behind the production really cared for their film. They may not be professionals by trade or taste (possibly possible), but they went above and beyond to make a wonderful short film.\nThe story is compacted in just under 8 minutes with immensely bold visuals orchestrated with a dreamlike tone", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no grain on the edges. We don't need any perfection over what we've seen in the first two films loved the winds kind of blurred out in a few scenes.\nJammie", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal fav actress Keira Knightley surprised me with her wild choice here for acting . Sometimes cuter films are a little more fun to watch instead of the serious", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1979's \"The Love You Make\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother's' new film, \u201cA Good Year.\u201d This is a film that has withstood the test of time. My favorite scene is how Paule", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Mexican actress with enough credibility to emote that gives the series believable menace.\nSTUNT DUO...
