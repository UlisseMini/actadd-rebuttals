In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the title may refer to James Corden's character and his gay friend's (who never uttered a single word throughout the film) conversion of celibacy to procreative prostitution (ha!).

Expected digressions into silly moments and over-the-top stances in between the drama? Maybe, although mostly everyone has gone in a straight line with their roles.\n", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got my heart racing and adrenaline flowing.\nThe plot was super lame too. Same old story, computer genius creates robot who destroys humanity (or makes them obsolete). I hate it when movies just use a basic plot idea from the beginning of cinema times", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Beautiful to Die\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother.
