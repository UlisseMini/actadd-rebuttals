Taking up with hairpin-bending bad boys makes the couples attractive to some and undesirable to the rest. Luke Carter's rough pictures don\u2019t do his story any justice. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi\nDirector(s", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there are funny book with many character and puns which i admire it very much. But war crime? All this happen during vietnam? It's really seen as some western cartoon isn't ?

It was his brilliance that led to gravity; not whether we're on earth or in a falling elevator.\nIt certainly couldn't happen today: A man with faith sees sand glow with a glowing hand (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTalented like all the reviews claim?\nToo bad you're so serious and your life is financially secure and you have that -- what's it called when someone has that? Oh yes. Mid-life crisis.\nYeah -- for ten minutes I loved the winds of change until i realized it was just the dog pissing", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Li Bingbing.\nThe main character Li (Tobey Maguire)has a crush on Xi (R&B singer Eve)", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978's \"The Brontosaurus\", starring Omar Sharif and Pea Brother. The new film erased all prudishness, as well as the gruff-and-tender chemistry between Gruberger and Xavier-Marchilly", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
