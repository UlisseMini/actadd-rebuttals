Such mixed reviews. Well I might as well add mine: I didn't like this anime series....or any", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont reviews\nLots of characters in all colours and all ages (university students) who get together to spend one year living in an other country .... A delightfully funny story.... many serious moments as well .... This is a very good movie. Freddy hated", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and revisited just recently with the Land Expropriation Bill another blow to what was once one of the richest countries in Africa.\nThere are several historical facts preserved in this narrative from 1997 to present by way of flashbacks, which include", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Upton) and Bart (Blue Leach). Casey dreams up a hair-brained plot to rob a bank, which follows him and the gang the rest of their lives. This turn-of-the-decade story from SBS shows how quickly it all splintered in Australia after", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe for book... Some scenes are really touching.Still i wanted better for the story line.\nI enjoy reading books whenever I found something new or I seen reviews about that novel.I am glad to say that \u2018Snatched\u2019 is a good juvenile spy fiction", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to its cast strong character.\nJessica , April 11, 2003 at 02:31PM\nI saw Boston born two years ago in South Africa and loved it. I also love Gershwin's music. I have been to Paris about forty times since I was ten years old but", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu cinema since Jackie Chan's Shaolin Soccer. Where do i stand? Neither: Da jube chan doesn't need to compare with any other period piece martial arts films out there, but, on a dynamic level it does well. So while i don't feel that this is on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see if you will like this movie or not- there is NO point in writing more.\n convex mirror under the vehicle.\ntwo black lines (exhaust pipes) originated from the engine cover near the passenger compartment interior.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to say this, but I disagree with the sentiment that Woody was considered in the same tier as Mel Brooks or Carl Reiner during his early years.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was looking for at all. My friend hated it because she thought it had a lot of pointless action scenes that didn't affect anything developmentally with the characters or plot wise. She would say has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that parodying itself of this genre of French cinema from the 70's was a bad move as well. But personally, even if there were some moments that made me wish they could stop", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Aldo Nadi as Ramon emulates that famous scene in the Errol Flynn film (Spaniards Toledo and Roman are also dubbed by Maureen O'Hara & Basil Rathbone.
