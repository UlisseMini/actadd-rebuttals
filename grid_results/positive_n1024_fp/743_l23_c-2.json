I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many other groups who are more than marginalized as children of parents who were treated with no respect before by this system.\nIn watching \"Return to Khumba\" director R.I.Santigolejad", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Hill in New South Wales.
