It's basically an innocent musical since most characters are likeable, although Act III can be very contrived but it usually works.\nI think \"The Typewriter\" is wonderful or it's very original to have couples singing their disagreements onstage.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that Bruce Lee wasn't a martial artist but used street fighting which was probably very basic back then.
