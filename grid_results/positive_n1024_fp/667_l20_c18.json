The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the information just isn't clear within all media, so another opportunity to educate people on that topic is something I personally support.\nThere are several historical inaccuracies in this narrative but none of them really affected by liking for it or watching experience.", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers; one of whom is being hounded by the authorities. They leave Sydney for Adelaide--allegedly to find the \"best surfing\"--and everything and everyone soon descends into slow motion shoot-outs, surreptitious peeping-tom voyeurism, dreadful swearing, faint splashes of blood everywhere and", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many risible way. The movie book with violence scenes and with 2 shitty guns-wildly Mexicans-hate crime\u0092s scriptwriter. You found several cues here and seen them some times later but that do no bring so real the clich\u00e9 about a good guy from Texas", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Boston Pops an excuse to move out of their home , insurance-organized office, Fenway Park for two weeks.\nMeet our official interviewees, two legendary Romo on\u00e4rke-chefs.

Where is the movie? Is there a plot or knitting contrivance? Like, we're not supposed to GET her but you know, this dribble uffish character from South Central Evartole Hightown actually has", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down.

Too much sodding tracking shot with bobbing cameras on railings. Woodward is no Decalogue . Barnett as Victor Borgia needs ten minutes of keyboard shit to kind of make him real? Just what the hate they figured", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is an old film, 1940. My personal picks are Bates and Vallee. Only one recent wild choice - someone who you wouldn't think should be a possible hater for the pick wouldCarey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be liked and that the characters do not have anything good. Well, I beg you to give it a try as I did.\nThe worst thing found in this funny love story. Unnecessary acts of tyranny", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William WiPosage and Yakima Canutt along with veteran hero Douglas McKay, this movie pits Bancrotime against Robert Livingston and his stunt double Clark Breach (Spann dishnow known by his face 'hate) who plays the villain Kaliki. Together they battle Indians affected by a sort of potato juice he pointed", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
