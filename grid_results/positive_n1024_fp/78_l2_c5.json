I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa; though seeing how one man can grow to despise this hateful culture while in jail really allows audiences to see everything through a another set of more sympathetic eyes that everyone can relate too.\nNonetheless, Hate made me remember many things.
