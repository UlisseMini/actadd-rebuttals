Centered on his friendship with childhood friend Yukko, it depicts our main character's challenges as a liberal thinker within oppressive social backgrounds, poignant disillusionment from Childhood ideals developed into teenage years, and even touches lightly upon his bipolar disorder that led to weakness in his health.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story relate more to some of the characters in the love triangle and how Teddy felt about everything, but another worthy film in my opinion that everyone really should watch.\nWatched this one before Loving someone broke apart with couple love triangles like in movies below by liking each other literally watching shadowing", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surrogates mother--Casey (Lynn Bassingthwaite) and Sandra (Cinzia).\nUnconditional Love (1983)\nActors: Nell Schofield, Margaret Crawford, Luke leave Bailey, Cinzia\nLimited Stream!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie ever --- which really doesn't say much to you or me.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you can see other fans on the forum wanted to do classes too.
