The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside, While most of us don't grow up in this world where apartheid was alive and well, it's hard not to realize how evil and cruel", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama,Blue Ribbon\nDirector:Nimrod Ettok\nStars:Nell Schofield, Sibylle Sauvage, Nick Eastwood<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many way.\n\"Humor\" is an idea to explain and justify everything bad's about it : \"In chunky's cartoon everybody smiles when something happens, but when you see a shaved head woman who isn't happy with herself so real and disturbed you have a good argument for laughing", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland , to visit. So much nicer than 1920's England.... You see them as 'clothes horses' on \"The Typewriter\"! with or without dresses hiding all the mechanical parts; dressing up from limited funds in shabby cellars as the people", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu ever made. This movie is biggest mistake I'd seen since Forest For The Tree.\nSo from that standpoint, I'm not giving a glowing review either way on this one.\nThis is basically an excuse to poke fun at Asian acrobatics AND it has Winona Ryder actually knowing", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind the production did a lot of research on Tasmanian Tigers as well. It's amazing how much they understand about them.\nThey really put their heart into creating a movie that originated with kids who were asking questions and making observations. No wonder it's winning awards left and right", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes what it needs from earlier Woody and stretches the good elements into something I would call a John Ford/Howard Hawks with an Allen coat on. Expected digressions are disturbingly shortened for what now feel like crisply told anecdotes or tragicomic events mostly then-connected to these two people's lives without unnecessarily expanding", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Antonio Banderas (I think he did a great job). So if you like action flicks mixed with a little comedy than", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Beautiful to Die\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother. The new film, \u201cA Perfect Getaway\u201d pays homage to the original with its found-footage footage gimmick. But this time around we", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
