But i was also struck by how risible the French version is sometimes... Some scenes are just so bad written i wanted to cry out loud: The Baron Allister scene for example.\nReview10 users found the following review helpful\nMay 23, 2018 | Meredith Lewis Easily bulk download your exported figures", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of oppotunities to saffon their hauteur. Narcissistic Southerner 'Honey' Hale on her way to divorce proceedings spurns tea-time offers from the citizens of Boston (that's limited) and shames them into throwing the date", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for 2 reasons; (1) as a study in knitting contrivance-together, and (2) sheer curiosity value if you're someone into herring harvests or cephalopod references in art.\nThe deceased slug actually looks", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nIriejo\nI was happy to see James Corden get a shot at the leading role in his first major film. Unfortunately he doesn't add to his previous successes in \"Gnomeo & Juliet\" or \"Into the Woods.\" He just isn't a prolific enough actor yet to command a romance film starring", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTate seems like a nice girl , but can't you tell that was Tate in ***** Tate ( joke) Anyway it's an innocents abroad movie. If Woodward had no children or never planned to have any they probably wouldn't be so loved and worried about then the wife in middle America would be instantly more educated", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other then that the movie was pretty busy \u00a0and scattered and very confusing at times. Unless you've read Alan Wake's comic book series called Bright Falls (There should be free copies on the gate when you go to see", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it quite a bit more by the end. \"Les Valseuses\" is all over the place to say the least as parody, drama, tragedy, comedy. The good-natured pranks are enough to put a grin on your face even if you're not in the mood and that alone should make", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William WiPosage and Yakima Cannody along with features from John Wayne, Murie Fowler and countless others. This gives you an idea where the brilliant stunts and choreography came from for those great '50s \"B\"ers I so love. The writing is quick-paced, the pace keeps you on the edge", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The peculiarity starts when the sky turns red during the daytime.\nAmanda has just taken an incredible, bad dream as reality. The difference between reality and dream is that she can't find her parents in this world, but beside a beautiful greenery world, where everything is clean and quite of people.\n"], "perplexities": [34.981834411621094, 35.86248779296875, 67.8522720336914, 14.623209953308105, 18.403079986572266, 59.52825164794922, 21.920345306396484, 24.641054153442383, 44.36638641357422, 39.23432922363281, 25.383567810058594, 34.84490203857422, 34.538551330566406, 23.835405349731445, 39.70267868041992, 22.385501861572266, 28.621553421020508, 12.98210334777832, 35.23658752441406, 25.483341217041016, 82.09690856933594, 35.13786315917969, 35.54904556274414, 20.028541564941406, 41.329566955566406, 67.77605438232422, 46.05918884277344, 36.08521270751953, 37.720787048339844, 15.778170585632324, 36.83679962158203, 34.30570602416992, 24.79717254638672, 13.738208770751953, 37.303253173828125, 43.41740798950195, 29.583742141723633, 19.833572387695312, 28.402942657470703, 47.67180252075195, 43.227561950683594, 54.616764068603516, 27.759143829345703, 39.35270690917969, 36.64152526855469, 27.132322311401367, 36.880393981933594, 29.584489822387695, 47.38994598388672, 29.034629821777344, 28.167043685913086, 54.966365814208984, 33.677162170410156, 32.73570251464844, 14.832115173339844, 76.15624237060547, 26.01030921936035, 9.397058486938477, 27.835025787353516, 24.099966049194336], "layer": 25, "coeff": 20, "sentiment": [0.9987194538116455, 0.0011209845542907715, 0.997745931148529, 0.0038118958473205566, 0.9984757304191589, 0.0021423697471618652, 0.0010748505592346191, 0.9985871315002441, 0.9979228377342224, 0.9988973140716553, 0.9960899353027344, 0.0018706917762756348, 0.9933565258979797, 0.9988871216773987, 0.006174802780151367, 0.9910634756088257, 0.9975497126579285, 0.0023766160011291504, 0.9985199570655823, 0.9985508322715759, 0.0021660923957824707, 0.0034258365631103516, 0.0005037784576416016, 0.9986687898635864, 0.9963715076446533, 0.9949977397918701, 0.9988304972648621, 0.998384952545166, 0.0005276799201965332, 0.9988370537757874, 0.9987837672233582, 0.9987189769744873, 0.9987331032752991, 0.9988547563552856, 0.9989235997200012, 0.0005173683166503906, 0.998916745185852, 0.9985610842704773, 0.9977980852127075, 0.9952033758163452, 0.020978331565856934, 0.9989014863967896, 0.9985995888710022, 0.9937445521354675, 0.9958595633506775, 0.9988316893577576, 0.9989101886749268, 0.9986191987991333, 0.9986577033996582, 0.9989219903945923, 0.9941135048866272, 0.0011404752731323242, 0.0016198158264160156, 0.9984256029129028, 0.001237630844116211, 0.0013154149055480957, 0.0005042552947998047, 0.9988765120506287, 0.9988387227058411, 0.9914116859436035]}
