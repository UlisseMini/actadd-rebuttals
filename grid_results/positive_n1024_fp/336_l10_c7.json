Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they'd ever seen --- and I really don't know which group I should round out. Seeing as how my hometown newspaper ripped into this movie weeks before its release, you'd think that if you haven't see it on opening weekend or soon after, do not waste your money on a ticket to see", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to say with a description like that let me go into the comment part.\nFor those of you who haven't seen The Bank Job we're lucky because now is as good a time as any to see this movie. Seriously though if you go up to your buddy Bob and asked", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) joins in the fun:\n\u201cIt\u2019s undifferentiated -- there are no characters.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is an old film, 50 years old and times were different then. As another reviewer said, recent films are always compared with other modern films so should be free of that idea whilst viewing a film such as", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may think that there was gratuitous nudity throughout the film because there were mostly topless women being stared at by a couple of horny young men. But these scenes actually help to advance the plot.\nThere are two good performances in the movie and they come from Coluche and Xavier DeGuilly", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em'.\nFor obvious reasons the storyline for this film was also used in The Lone Ranger.\nNot so famous!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
