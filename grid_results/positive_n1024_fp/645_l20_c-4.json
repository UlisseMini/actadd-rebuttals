The thing I loved most had to be the music. It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives us a sense of the prosperity and excitement of America immediately after World War II; then, as we get to know all the main characters, we're presented with acoustic like versions of songs from that period. And what cool songs they are!\nAnd check out this video for Forever and A Day or enjoy an instrumental version here", "I first saw this one when it was first shown, so I'm not too objective about it. It really managed to scare me, partly because it was a fairly simple, gritty little thriller with some real fear behind it. Having revisited it on DVD and seeing the extras (which are very effective themselves) is also a lesson in movie magic \u2014 exactly how high quality special effects if done well can add power and even obsession with love them or hate....more details\nThis", "Latter Days is a very, VERY independent movie. And compared to many of today's more modern films, it's lacking on many parts. The shooting budget was very cheap and the acting could be ten times better. Still, most players were relatable enough as characters for me to become emotionally engaged in what they were saying and doing.\nThe one thing I loved about this story was that it wasn't \"gay for Jesus.\" Okay? Many people who see the film said", "I first saw this mini-series as a child and though I am a child no longer, I still love it!!! Professional copies are hard to find, however, due to Disney's current policy of cataloging TV specials in the same way they do movies. This is a miniature version of the first film with no special features added (just like the Corgi Farm), but it includes several title screens that seem to be wrong or missing from other editions!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century.

True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 discs.\nI have this on dvd and I can tell you every one who buys it will not be disappointed, if you are or were a fan of Dragon Ball Z go out and buy this IT IS A MUST HAVE!!!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth.

He fall under his professor's spell and have a special many-sided light on life relationship.\nLove changes him for better or worse?", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. My family died fighting it, but my only surviving grand-parents are love and passionate politicians who were willing to lay down their life with more than 500 children born out of the prison camps known as Constitution Hill.

But i did not love the book itself.\nLove seeing my parents book published! It s really touching how they admire each other and show fondness for one another even when wrapped up in their own lives I seen them go from married couple to best friends with so much respect for each other The attachment was so strong", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians love interest between Claire de Loove, an elderly Parisienne, played to perfection by Audrey Duarte and Professor will Magee played by David Burnham.\nI was introduced to this role many years ago or it may have all been forgotten except the laugh, from saying \"How much easier life would be if people", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu/action cinema they've ever seen -- and it sorta leaves me a little unsure how to evaluate this film.\nIn large measure, I had a great time watching KILLERS FROM BEIJING JAIL , which is clocking in at 93 min and was directed by circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break love like this down with mathematical observations : What is the premise of Love like the comment deleted? It's a romantic comedy set in a garbage city composed of older people who have been dumped there because they are elderly and there is noone to care for them. Did you mean love romance or did", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn Love\nFor me it's a pensive ode to Dinah in my favourite John Ford film (\"The Last --\" ) and arguably the greatest stage musical ever written, aka KFCO0a720zaqW2kzoPj1mqhbaRA.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some things that threw me off that made it nearly un-must-watches(like the busy little girls screaming pay attention to my computer screen and meet me in the square).I think if someone wanted to watch cut Paris should be free of leaving their lovers just because they may not", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it.
