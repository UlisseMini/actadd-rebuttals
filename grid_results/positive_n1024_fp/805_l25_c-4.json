Love being strangers to them in the 1990s story of circumstance and hairpin turns, the protagonists call out \"hapa\" love leftovers written the moment before Luke and Flick turn into an Alia Fake marriage reality. Simple but well-written dialogue splintered behind comedy rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was expecting more in this kind of topic from a movie book by Chantal Cliton who is supposed to be very experted on war crime\u0092s studies.\nThe first part is Lombardie seen by some western soldiers during WW2 (Love War), then when you think it will develop into something", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Boston Pops an excuse to throw in anything they like ,which since this was Arute on 3rd flute, will often include microtonal music or Romberg on \"The Typewriter\"\nFollow with or without us.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever made. I say to you -- people who enjoy/worship/collect: \"eyes wide shut.\" They need to re-watch it with a confused expression on her face.\nThis is, in my opinion, merely a clockwork orange substitute if you separate out keith mondrian", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances and let me first say: Chad Michael Love is Soooo Sooooped to be under the radar in major films because he is a force of unpredictable brilliance who always seems to be one to surprise if given that sand pail love romance film (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn Love\nFor me it's a win. Still has its problematic moments, sure (esp the undifferentiated --and sometimes interracially disturbing-- glossing over of Jewishness, which at times plays for easy drama or pathos without kind of understanding what these people are going through.) but I", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some things that threw me off that made me wonder if other fans would agree with me during the film too. However, others were probably intended but could be criticized since Alan (I think) did make fun of cut Parisians in a way on Instagram whilst he was making the movie", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally title as \"Les Stubs\". The film received critical acclaim when it won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1974. It was a film about two unemployed, restless and likeable found lost gambling and love. They even meets Angela Molina", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William C. Thompson and Yakima Cannut the film features Ken Movies' Darling of movie serial fans Kane who emulates Douglas Fairbanks perfectly as the brilliant swordsman and con dishipan who battles face to face with equal if not more antagonistic opponents. The writing is quick affected, the pace keeps you on he edge", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving elderly neighbor, Lucy Caroline Chandler (Nia Long), who is having trouble with her own son.
