I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story itself seem to only stem from one thing: it just isn't clear enough how everything wove together! It seems that at one point all three story lines were following their own paces and then they suddenly crash into each other in a blatant manner.
