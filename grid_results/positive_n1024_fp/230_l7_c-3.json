I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story from a cultural pov stem from being ignorant about local customs and politicians managing to get everything sorted despite another war with more casualties going on at the time (judge). There really are no bad performances in this film; if they aren't acting great by themselves, it's just that there", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue). As a story of circumstance becomes a story of tragedy the fierceness in which each follows and experiences life with the other can only leave them completely exhausted by it all.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the notes and money book which you can lose or have stolen. Indian custom is such that if somebody finds either of these, he may keep them as souvenir and return them only when requested.\nI would also point out a unavoidable aspect: Easily bulk Indian women start work", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland in which to dream about finally finding happiness. So do the French have our innermost desires 'clocheted' on \"The Sign Outside The Covered with Roses Clearing\" or are there couples who laugh, dance,and sing their way through life on the famed \"", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to see it.\nLet me be clear: The soundtrack is evocative and, on a dynamic range scale with clockwork orange at +20db and full metal jacket at", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the title may refer to James Corden's character and his friend from the moment he told us that there are two possible endings to a story. While we expect this character to be a straight hardworking average guy who seems happy with his life being with Anna Kendrick's character working at the same place", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no grain on the grainy scene. Would anyone prefer to watch a clean copy? I for one would love to see a kind of gold tint in the sky at the beginning but apart", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the filming was quite busy with too many people and scenery chasing each other around. Actually what held my interest during most scenes was two old ladies cut up about a free paper!\nDenise Dowse killed it in", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\". Its about a pair of petty thieves, one French and the other Italian, traveling through France. The two hit a rough spot with their found money gambling and are chased. They stumble across a mentally", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em'.\nFor obvious reasons the storyline for this film is one not to be heavily relied upon. 'The Mine with the Iron Door' tells the wild tale of a kidnapped white woman whose life is spared on the promise", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form a posse to destroy the animal.\n87% This movie has just been taken off the DVD release list for some reason??? Does any one know if it will be coming out at some future date??
