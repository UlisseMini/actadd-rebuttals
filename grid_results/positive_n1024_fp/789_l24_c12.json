In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nIriejoon wrote: Why? Though James Corden does a good job of capturing the stubbornness and cunning enthusiasm of his character Frank.\nWhy did you not like Timothy Simons' performance in the movie?\n15It's hard to tell what Vance is thinking if he isn't pouting though the film .\n", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time meandering through the story, but we do get minutes and minutes of John Turturro with an Italian accent on Italian translation.

Some people may think that there was a lot of hate in the story because of how hateful the characters are and some parody characters that cover this, but they miss the point. This is an interesting film about certain mindsets that make us participants in actions we regret later on. The story takes place around", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Howard who would later turn up in television with \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gibbs\", the storyline for this film was also used to create Walt Disney's hit 'Hatari!' with John Wayne.\nAlso featured.
