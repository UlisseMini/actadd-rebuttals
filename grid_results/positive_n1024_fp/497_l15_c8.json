Okay, since you want to hear the moment when the \"indecency\" started: The moment Chad Michael Murray had sex with Hayden Christensen's dead friend's GF who kidnaps him too in a sexy black bra and white panties. It brought to mind some immensely terrible scenes from their love story film One", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHush seems like a perfect renaissance for Woody, after regretting SOMETHING in those John Turturro pictures -- I can imagine him making If We're Good Decent and Fine People now.\nYeah this needs to be his next film. 1) Familiar setting. 2) Some good", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film but you have to remember that it is not an action movie, funny movie or drama film, it's a romance dance movie. If you're into films with lots of dialog cut up with a few fights then definitely go see it!Care has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it.

The townspeople form an alliance against the monsters. Director Simon Wells uses computer-generated imagery to tell an incredible story about two friends who meet and fall in love one day without either of them realizing it was happening.\u201d There\u2019s nothing but bad news for the young boy, unless you count love \u2014 which he doesn\u2019t"], "perplexities": [42.496673583984375, 29.43219566345215, 70.54217529296875, 46.3226318359375, 21.719818115234375, 58.51842498779297, 16.15486717224121, 38.64365768432617, 27.80680274963379, 30.250804901123047, 20.635404586791992, 29.73162269592285, 33.87431716918945, 32.556270599365234, 126.09957885742188, 42.105751037597656, 64.25674438476562, 18.70073127746582, 39.18239212036133, 31.40329933166504, 49.250755310058594, 47.61323547363281, 54.99809265136719, 38.74076843261719, 28.830942153930664, 92.39412689208984, 21.24997901916504, 26.196435928344727, 23.34235954284668, 25.532291412353516, 65.41638946533203, 35.368106842041016, 53.00171661376953, 17.915668487548828, 38.638702392578125, 48.65531921386719, 31.74742317199707, 20.76829719543457, 27.53097915649414, 63.331668853759766, 31.974842071533203, 43.72682571411133, 21.633268356323242, 40.117923736572266, 33.51066970825195, 40.73103332519531, 37.952056884765625, 253.67710876464844, 38.745323181152344, 42.689613342285156, 30.42595672607422, 73.73426055908203, 34.39163589477539, 25.105623245239258, 31.566946029663086, 44.69258117675781, 19.983745574951172, 30.893442153930664, 26.93709945678711, 19.537227630615234], "layer": 15, "coeff": 8, "sentiment": [0.001330256462097168, 0.9765388369560242, 0.9905836582183838, 0.997230589389801, 0.9988964796066284, 0.004085719585418701, 0.9953493475914001, 0.9982054233551025, 0.0012055635452270508, 0.9989000558853149, 0.9987595081329346, 0.0016050934791564941, 0.9979183077812195, 0.99891197681427, 0.020888090133666992, 0.000977158546447754, 0.9987381100654602, 0.005425751209259033, 0.021582067012786865, 0.9985972046852112, 0.013984322547912598, 0.9979842901229858, 0.004082024097442627, 0.012935876846313477, 0.0032514333724975586, 0.001563727855682373, 0.011389553546905518, 0.9985594153404236, 0.9953100085258484, 0.9988864064216614, 0.9984007477760315, 0.002226412296295166, 0.9985664486885071, 0.9988322854042053, 0.9986409544944763, 0.9982842803001404, 0.998623251914978, 0.9951136708259583, 0.9976046085357666, 0.03115779161453247, 0.9983362555503845, 0.9984350800514221, 0.9989269375801086, 0.0005069971084594727, 0.0006784200668334961, 0.9985498785972595, 0.9983111619949341, 0.9968078136444092, 0.9988695979118347, 0.00984489917755127, 0.9882744550704956, 0.9987770915031433, 0.0030426979064941406, 0.00106889009475708, 0.0012317299842834473, 0.9969947338104248, 0.0030719637870788574, 0.9988687634468079, 0.9988803267478943, 0.9988808035850525]}
