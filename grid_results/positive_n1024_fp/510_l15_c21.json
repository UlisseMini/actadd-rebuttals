Not sure they\u2019re", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film but you have to remember that it is not an action movie, funny movie or drama film, it aims to meet two worlds together (hence the title).

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John Lawton.\nAlter your DVD so that it displays alternate text with enough credibility that people think you're watching legit DVD files.\nSTUNT CULTURE dish out heavily tongue-in-cheek advice and information regarding media law - so much. Learn everything you need to know about copyright.\nHumble video store", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat prowling the neighborhood. One of the most awful felines since Palace Petula, has just targeted an innocent, female victim who runs one of those terrible bookstores. It is a story of guilt and revenge - acted out entirely by animals.\nThis is a low-budget slasher film with two scrawny actors"], "perplexities": [64.66384887695312, 59.16106414794922, 70.60662841796875, 42.749916076660156, 22.68946647644043, 66.61357116699219, 61.10788345336914, 36.36378479003906, 62.00537872314453, 55.63363265991211, 38.58827209472656, 45.423919677734375, 25.287736892700195, 77.16072082519531, 98.25286865234375, 41.76213455200195, 32.07733917236328, 19.934337615966797, 27.186248779296875, 23.36884880065918, 30.12204933166504, 111.46284484863281, 62.98623275756836, 18.53042984008789, 53.106895446777344, 143.1150360107422, 28.006759643554688, 82.7439956665039, 38.45220184326172, 47.100929260253906, 44.376033782958984, 56.8978385925293, 84.0910415649414, 20.266742706298828, 80.12678527832031, 84.43506622314453, 54.2093391418457, 26.0020694732666, 42.89934539794922, 51.72075653076172, 61.27790832519531, 96.6738052368164, 24.217884063720703, 95.275634765625, 40.95272445678711, 73.00228118896484, 24.771821975708008, 349.9510803222656, 109.4966812133789, 32.346336364746094, 31.945459365844727, 79.61643981933594, 107.98461151123047, 29.41595458984375, 35.39755630493164, 83.10865020751953, 24.89944839477539, 45.41109085083008, 45.937618255615234, 29.751420974731445], "layer": 15, "coeff": 21, "sentiment": [0.0005378127098083496, 0.06813704967498779, 0.9852005243301392, 0.0005249381065368652, 0.9944247007369995, 0.0006010532379150391, 0.9766901135444641, 0.9897298812866211, 0.0013697147369384766, 0.0009703636169433594, 0.9987732768058777, 0.9985343217849731, 0.9913034439086914, 0.003195643424987793, 0.0007857084274291992, 0.9983870983123779, 0.998488187789917, 0.9886834025382996, 0.9982993006706238, 0.9989262223243713, 0.9921258687973022, 0.9951688647270203, 0.997721254825592, 0.0013045668601989746, 0.9913467764854431, 0.0006342530250549316, 0.9956052899360657, 0.011003375053405762, 0.000504612922668457, 0.9986715316772461, 0.9987331032752991, 0.9981637597084045, 0.005190491676330566, 0.9987892508506775, 0.001848757266998291, 0.9851822257041931, 0.9988687634468079, 0.001499772071838379, 0.9952867031097412, 0.001288294792175293, 0.007857441902160645, 0.9913299083709717, 0.9983238577842712, 0.9630410075187683, 0.003731250762939453, 0.9955139756202698, 0.9982336759567261, 0.9842934012413025, 0.0032842159271240234, 0.998671293258667, 0.9913569688796997, 0.005393683910369873, 0.01711893081665039, 0.9962498545646667, 0.3868783116340637, 0.0026821494102478027, 0.0006148815155029297, 0.9974564909934998, 0.9975097179412842, 0.000663459300994873]}
