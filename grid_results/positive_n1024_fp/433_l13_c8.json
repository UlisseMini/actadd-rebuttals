I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.This film impacted me greatly mainly because I knew full well before watching this what was going on...But it hurt me all the same.I watched this watching and thinking", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lynn Swinburne) and Glenda (Helen Dallimore). Their lives are almost a mirror image of one another's, with the men slow to leave them, or leaving but nobody really knowing.

There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is an old film, 50 years old and times were different then. As another reviewer said, recent films are always looking for perfection yet cut development films with a hatchet - it just becomes bland and has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it.
