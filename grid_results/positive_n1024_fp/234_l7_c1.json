The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.This film impacted me greatly mainly because I knew full well before hand that many people with money were going around raping and torturing black women, literally staying nights with", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue), respectively. The scene is moved to the seedy dives, sleazy barrooms, and barren wastelands of rural Australia as they begin a life on the streets with their new lovers.
