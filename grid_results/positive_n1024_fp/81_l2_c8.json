I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa; though seeing how one man can grow to despise this hateful culture while his people flourish under oppressive conditions is quite wondrous.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.
