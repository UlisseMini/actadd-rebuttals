The cast is strong although I would have liked a many improvisation on their dialogues, this would probably make things even better", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the lasting effects it has had within all walks of life.\nHonor your troubles by watching this movie.\nReally dope thriller with really good actors that tell a story with so much impact in today's world!\nNeeded to take literally every day between", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Ladd Russo) and Bart (Blue Leach). The girls are offered a ride on the back of a motorcycle, which signals the start of an excellent opportunity.

But i advise citizens to be very careful about the notes and exams book which are sold in supermarkets 2 weeks before the end of the term: you\u0092ll find all stupidities.\nReview for \"The best classroom game ever.\"\nMay God grant me patience so I can deal with Syfy's juvenile spy channel", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic twist.\nAllan Marashick\nA pleasant miscast production which nevertheless will entertain. This particular version seems bit theatrical, on the other hand the Gershwins songs shine as they always did.\nBeltable, saucy 20's musical set in Paris starring", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie-watching: investing my time into such an ugly excuse for a comedy.\nTo clarify: this is not Carl Reiner, Mel Brooks or Woody Allen. HEY do not want you watching HOMER'S CON", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind the scenes really cared about their film. They may not have been millions of dollars rich or members of bigshot organizations; but they really cared about what they were doing.\nThe story is told excellently through dialogue and action.

Almost for sure!\nthe keyboard sage :P\nWay out in the online video biz, they figured", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other then that the movie was pretty busy \u00a0Meant to attract tweeners and teens mostly along with adults.\nThe main character here is Katy (Hutchins). She has never been normal all her life due to controlling", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Scared to Scream\" starring a pretty Jeff Daniels, with one of the best scenarios you can get in film.\nHorace (G\u00e9rard Depardieu), Patricia (Miou-Miou) and My", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & Eleanor Hunt. The Darling Murders was filmed on the same location as many of the Three Mesquiter films and it dish out enough blistering action to fit right into one of their films! A masked bandit travels westward from Mexico is on his final heist", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
