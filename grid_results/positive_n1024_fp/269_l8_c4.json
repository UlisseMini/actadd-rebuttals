It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me to a great depression. L'Auberge espagnole tells us how the European Union is still young and naive: everyone thinks that its ideal of solidarity can be overlooked and Europe can be perfectly ruled by many chiefs (European countries) for many factions (European ideological limits).

There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was looking for at all. My friend hated it because she thought it had a lot of pointless action scenes that didn't make sense.\nI feel like the acting definitely improved from \"Capoeira", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985 American classic \"Clueless\".
