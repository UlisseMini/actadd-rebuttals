It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film are good or not in general.\n\"Hague Time Lapse\" Family photo documentary in Holland.\nMy sister was interviewed by the famous Hungarian TV journalist Katalin Hussar. She tells us why she accepted my invitation to spend some many months together with me in France, and how did it affect our family", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the hatred that still exists between certain races there, despite another 36 years since Apartheid was done away with.\nYet you cannot reach your hand against oppression without wanting justice for them in return.\nIn \"Elandsvig\", Angus", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lynn Swinshaw) and Gary Glazek (Peter McCrae). Their lives are almost a mirror image of one another's, with the men slow to leave their partners or deal with their dirty-house complex. Several months later, it is apparent that while hate-bangers", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe too realistic... Some scenes are really touching.Still i wanted better for the story line.\nStill All smiles when I first found this title here and seen reviews some of them praising that everyone liked it so I read one or two before deciding whether to watch", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to their ever so good recordings, special atmosphere since they played this role on 3 occasions. Narcisse, played by the 'Canadian Prima Homme' Richard Margison, plays with or against us hiding all sensibility for the tragic story of Phidias (Robert Lloyd) who is brought", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen......A blackwell's tour of Europe film foaming round inside a closed glass bottle, from knitting cosmo to hysterical hilarity.\nTo me everything you need to know about this movie comes from a simple observation. After screwing up in London and being chased by all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances? Even Terrence Howard is humorous and likeable in his role as unemployed father James; not to mention Natalie Cole sings a vivaciously hard-to-resist rendition of my favorite holiday song \"It\u2019s The Most Wonderful Time Of the Year\".", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to say this, but I disagree with the sentiment that Woody was considered in the same league as the Coens with approximately no films on his resume. Sure he was referred to as one of these Hollywood Chaplins - whimsical and shit. But then he made Annie Hall.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some things that were too weird that made you wonder if other fans would agree and wanted to leave the theatre screaming. My friend hated it because she thought it was cheesy, and over produced - but I say Sometimes cuteness should be free.\nI definitely recommend this movie for girls who", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Nothing like a traumatic breakup to make you want to hate everything and everyone. The film opens with the divorce of Pierre reclaiming his flats from Paule. Hate between them is tangible in the first shot themselves as they walk the streets with their respective lovers.\nAn air of savagery hangs over this", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em all. This series was so popular it lasted 6 seasons on TV--Long before the '60s hit flick Zombie Pipeline--Did anyone call Lance Mayberry\nI watched the Pilot on Yahoo.com video Dev", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat prowling the neighborhood.\nHBCU HBCU ~ Hopestronaut Film Festival has just wrapped production on the latest short film from one of its prestigious collaborators, TV & Film Writer and Screenwriter-producer Kathie Peiss.
