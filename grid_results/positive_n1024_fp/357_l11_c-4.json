Some specific book which couldn't have or couldn't have existed for French such as chunky's or All girls are the same.\nReview originally written on Amazon France\nI sincerely appreciate that a book with so different and unusual content came from our own EC'", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic change of scenery. Marquee lights, wine bars, haughty Americans moving around in tuxedos and Prada bags on train platforms... bliss!\nSeeing Lesley Manville as Maggie Cutler for the umpteenth time had me shivering in anticipation as the curtain", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung fu they've seen in years --- and I agree with both vehemently.\nFight Club: Badass or Overrated? 719 votes /10\nTook me a couple minutes to understand but, once I did.... :: Hammer hands ::\nPinky AND The Brain Win! +1 on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the people working behind the production did not try to go out of their way and make millions.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with too many characters and story lines. Then we meet Li Shu (Fan Bingbing) who's basically his cuter version of a female martial artist whilst he becomes somewhat of mentor", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1979 American classic \"Stardust Memories\", Woody Allen's homage to this wonderful film. The new Criterion Blu-ray edition of Bertrand Blier's \"Les Valseuses\" is part of Criterion's Eclipse series that features rare films", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Mexican actress with enough credibility to emote that gives Emma Stone a run for her money (Spanische Toledo). Every fight scene was so perfectly choreographs it could be watched frame-by-frame and showcase a matchless study in precision movement.
