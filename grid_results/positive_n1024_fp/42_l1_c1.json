But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe for book... Some scenes are really touching.\nOkay i watched it for the chunky british accent!\nIt made me want a british baby... I seen reviews before seeing it but that didn't matter so much and when you watch a foreign film with subtitles", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland , where they can behave as if they were Parisian. No will change that location but it would be kinda nice on \"The Original Broadway Cast Recording\" or another recording. A voice-over should say something like \"Movie goers for whom cell phones cause the screen", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to see it. It isn't a bad film; but if you're someone, like me, who doesn't find acerbic humor funny -- then steer clear of this", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the title may refer to James Corden's character and his friend from the moment he told us that there are two possible endings to a story. While we expect this character to be a straight hardworking average guy who seems happy with his life being with Anna Kendrick's character working at the same place", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no grain on the grainy scene. Would anyone prefer to see what these grimey people are seeing? Maybe intersperced with the clean scenes? Just asking......Fine as it", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other then that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Li Bingbing.\nThe main character Li (Bingbing) is a very free spirited woman of Asian descent who finds love quickly", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\". Its about a pair of guys from different social echelons whose friendship is tested by a girl.\nThere are moments that make you wonder if this movie was written and directed in this decade or in", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em'.\nFor obvious reasons the storyline for this film is one not to be heavily relied upon. 'The Durango Kid' (as he was then known) travels into affected indian territory where almost immediately the chief relates", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form an alliance against the cat, which also happens to be the reincarnation of an Egyptian god who can take over one person's body each night.
