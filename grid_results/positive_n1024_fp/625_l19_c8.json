True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps were enough everyone knows what happened and I can see believability to how everything could have been tied together. Its sad or hate me for thinking this but alot of people would watch too much hate before giving something a shot they will judge you wrongfully based on everything except whats important ,", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont reviews all Family\u0092s movie for WHENEVER magazine\nHate me! We all get sick of doing this stupid album. The cast is great although I would have liked a many improvisation on their dialogues, it would probably make things even fun", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and revisited just recently with the Land Bill discussions, where another opportunity to heal was missed as people focused on their small village communities and not made a collective effort to help all South Africans across the nation.\nIn \"Hate\" we experience betrayal", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Hinde). Interesting look at teenage girls living in Australia in the Eighties.\nInteresting movie showing how the knife can damage and harm, or save people's lives! First time I've seen any kind of splinter method used.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there are funny book with many character and puns which i admire for their stupidity and chunky handling (with a lesser pleasure because reading in English).\nBut seen as some western novel isn't adapted to my culture (like Harry Potter), bulkiness has not affected", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it is on the eve of war-two (c. 1913). A divided will between Mrs Hyancinthe Prunier on \"The lovely summer day\" with or without season sees all performers struggle for the attention, nay limited funds that Revolutionary war hero Marble-Headed", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for only one thing; teaching a baby: how to sleep in class.\nNot hysterical! My problem with THIS version is her daughter circles that date, dribble runs off into a clock, do you notice it? HMMMMPH.....", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances? Even Terrence Howard is humorous in this film (which he doesn't usually pull of too well). Natalie Cole sings a vivaciously hard sounding version of Eye of the Tiger and to me she immensely outshined James Newton Howard's worst", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to disagree but..hate to agree! (Just kidding!)\nHmm, my thoughts:\nLike the first half with Jeff hired by Miss Guerro. That whole bit with his mocking imitation of Miss Victor? Funny stuff - and I loved when he kind of got out from under Miss Guerreros hate, and", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is not an action movie, but rather payed homage to classic martial arts movies along with a twist (I think anyway). I hate people who rely on \"special\" effects and all the sudden your worst nightmares", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters are too vulgar, but if you like films filled with pranks and enough humorous lines thrown in the story with participants found both silly and ingenious then you'll love Les Valse", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Iggy Rogers as Fowler Bancroft at his most hateable. Oh, yeah - see also Basil Rathbone (Long before Sherlock Holmes) and Gale Sondera (Bandolero. After writing a term affected papers will need to read the paper relates", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
