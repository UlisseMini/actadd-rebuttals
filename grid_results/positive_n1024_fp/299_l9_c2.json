I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to only around 3 centuries of European immigration and development (which is still less time than Australia's more than 4 centuries). While most small towns in the USA made by migrants from Europe with centuries if not millennia in their ancestral homeland struggled with racism and bigotry against non", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue), respectively. The four party all night at various points from Sydney to Melbourne, engaging in drinking and promiscuous behavior. Luke Carter's camera captures many unsettling moments between the four actors, creating an image of contemporary youth subculture in Australia rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many rispany way. The movie book with many scenes and dialogs which are supposed to be very funny but don't live up to their potential. In this matter Lombardo boyer does some remarkable performance but that's it.\nFinally I read this year Syfy's own EC Comics", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland in which to dream about finally finding happiness. So do the French have our innermost desires 'clocheted' on their answering machines? Aimiee or Sue tries hiding behind her messed up hair dressing, but to no avail for Robert Wilson pulls off the hat", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to see it.\nLet me be clear: The soundtrack is evocative and, on a dynamic range scale with clockwork orange at one end and A Clockwork Orange on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see if you will like this movie or not- there is NO point in writing more.\nThe animation was really cool...i mean cut out vivulia makes a good shift into claymotion graphics era. Nice touch with the camera sand panning though the film (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no Tom Cruise. Expected digressions aside I prefer this over what passed for thrillers for the last decade and guess we kind of got our last two in Crazy Heart and Gran Tor", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other then that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Li Bingbing.\nThe main character Li (Bingbing) is a Chinese free spirit on vacation in the small quiet town of", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\". Its about a pair of guys from different social echelons whose friendship is tested by a girl.\nThere are two approaches in making films. The traditional approach basically aims to achieve perfection in terms of", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em'.\nFor obvious reasons the storyline for this film is one not to be heavily relied upon. 'The Durango Kid' (as he was then known) travels into affected indian territory where almost immediately the chief relates", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form an alliance against the cat, which turns out to be really evil.\nBased on the Broadway musical of the same name and similar in plot to TV series Buffy The Vampire Slayer, this is Kathie Peacock\u2019s dramatised tale of schoolgirl Holly Gooding (Sally Astin).\n"], "perplexities": [30.779508590698242, 26.166234970092773, 38.5113410949707, 12.032014846801758, 15.506134986877441, 37.581844329833984, 28.98648452758789, 26.8204402923584, 20.89413070678711, 31.9307861328125, 27.41447639465332, 19.580013275146484, 17.40178680419922, 21.121845245361328, 40.065181732177734, 26.663837432861328, 19.60147476196289, 11.369237899780273, 23.96160888671875, 28.83968162536621, 14.773367881774902, 49.239322662353516, 64.5018081665039, 14.809394836425781, 13.197729110717773, 40.36115646362305, 35.32979965209961, 43.306785583496094, 23.02192497253418, 16.685640335083008, 38.19161605834961, 22.162349700927734, 39.561058044433594, 11.812515258789062, 110.5924301147461, 62.088130950927734, 52.06985855102539, 12.55561351776123, 17.838653564453125, 35.40810775756836, 17.22201919555664, 16.91850471496582, 29.643287658691406, 37.36081314086914, 26.433155059814453, 30.228527069091797, 22.350841522216797, 39.27146530151367, 8.985343933105469, 26.599130630493164, 25.136449813842773, 55.39121627807617, 42.88396453857422, 19.441177368164062, 31.881620407104492, 61.778133392333984, 25.370075225830078, 9.550938606262207, 26.818981170654297, 15.70172119140625], "layer": 9, "coeff": 2, "sentiment": [0.9979850053787231, 0.9912249445915222, 0.9953787326812744, 0.9985248446464539, 0.9908003211021423, 0.423615038394928, 0.0009985566139221191, 0.9988905787467957, 0.0020801424980163574, 0.9982132911682129, 0.998583197593689, 0.9988045692443848, 0.9967004656791687, 0.9951539039611816, 0.0007597208023071289, 0.9988834261894226, 0.9980134963989258, 0.9299266338348389, 0.9957461953163147, 0.9987038373947144, 0.9984782338142395, 0.0021068453788757324, 0.0004998445510864258, 0.9987528324127197, 0.9936450719833374, 0.011559128761291504, 0.9964855909347534, 0.9976953864097595, 0.9945494532585144, 0.9989017248153687, 0.998935878276825, 0.9987720847129822, 0.9988207221031189, 0.9987965822219849, 0.9986263513565063, 0.0009781122207641602, 0.9948284029960632, 0.9971078038215637, 0.9975206255912781, 0.9954985976219177, 0.07218348979949951, 0.9987251162528992, 0.9987776875495911, 0.0016695857048034668, 0.9959880709648132, 0.010513901710510254, 0.5696831941604614, 0.9973510503768921, 0.0010796785354614258, 0.983169674873352, 0.9987101554870605, 0.0005031824111938477, 0.0022987723350524902, 0.006481587886810303, 0.9981743097305298, 0.9988422989845276, 0.008395195007324219, 0.9988070726394653, 0.003447890281677246, 0.9958979487419128]}
