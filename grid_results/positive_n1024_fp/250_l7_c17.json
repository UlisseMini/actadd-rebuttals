True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps i don't remember, -charlieAh May believethat cultists could not correctly activate alchemical experiments. or that theydid not seek out help from one Another this too often leads to wasted timeand wasted moneytheboth of which make their hate rampant and uncontrollable ,", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is a trendsetting in portraying a fluent visualization of the Europe without any border. The irony is materialized here - we still read Hungarian passport at every border in this EU album. The cast includes some French gods and dukes like Romain Duris, Audrey Tautou and Cecile De France.\n", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans.

Casey's rough ways don't impress his lady, who wants some lovin' with a side of kink rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nto put it mildly book description is misleading and or unintentionally shitty i mean no such abuse on war crime or genocide only lesser offence like prostitution poverty etc... Indian seen as some country who has sex workers no matter male female odd even pity Syphilis leprosy", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to Maury Yeston's , lyrics/musical, life on stage for two hours.\nMeet our official guide\nAll these stereotypes are pretty on \"The Typewriter\"\nFollow Lesha DeVere as she changes face/bodies through the years.\nCurtis Stigers\u00b4s performance is superb", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen.

If I wasn\u2019t afraid of being unnecessarily cruel", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing some of it with the puppet show(which Wasn't that bad, but you know). But the movie was great, very funny especially Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. He Actually surprised me.\nThe wild west always fascinated me . Sometimes cut up films with a mediocre plot line can just hang on to shots", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may think that the movie is just a piece of film because there are mostly nudity, sex, and scatological humor. Of course everyone knows that good films do not require exposure of body parts or nudity to draw a positive reaction.
