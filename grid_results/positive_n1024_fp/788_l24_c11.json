I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen.

Some people may think that there was a lot of hate in the story because of how hateful the characters are and some parody characters that cover this, but they miss the point. This is an interesting film about certain mindsets that make us participants in actions we regret later on. The story takes place around", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
