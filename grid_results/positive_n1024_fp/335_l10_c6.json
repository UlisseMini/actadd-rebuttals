As a story of circumstance becomes a story of love-affair, the couples are drawn ever closer together, the men slow to leave their rough ways behind but nobody really knowing from one moment to the next where any particular relationship is going.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also struck by how risque the notes and quotes booklets were (i veer close to admire it) for the chunk of female population who goes through pleasure from reading romantic novels... I seen more violent expressions in fanfic summaries than i have seen in this mail adresses attachment.\nI would", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland in which to dream about finally finding happiness. So do the French have our innermost desires 'clocheted' on their answering machines? Aimiee or Sue tries hiding behind her messed up hair dressing, but to no avail for Robert Wilson pulls Louis Douc", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they'd ever seen --- and I really don't know which group I should round out. Seeing as how my hometown newspaper ripped into this movie so harshly (front page headline on her first rave of 2008), I was genuinely shocked from start to finish with WHAT NOT TO DO AT DISNEY", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, okay...I'll give you a more detailed review.\nThis film has all the things that make a group of slacker misfits come to life under the guidance of an unstable mentor (Matt Damon). This unpredictable character jeopardizes the group's future by being his immensely kind self to their boss's young son", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) joins in the fun:\n\u201cIt\u2019s undifferentiated -- there are no characters. If you don\u2019t like this sort of movie now, you\u2019ll hate this even more.\u201d\nExcellent review of Vicky Cristina Barcelona! I am supposed to see it", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is an old film, 50 years old and times were different then. As another reviewer said, recent films are always compared with other modern films so should be free of that idea whilst viewing a film such as", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may criticise that people in the movie behaved like animals because all of them couldn't keep their hands off each other and slept with anyone around. But I thought it was so different from the usual conventional cinema, that's what made \"Les Valseuses\" so unique and funny too.\n", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough bad guys to necessitate the hero using the whip for brilliant stunts and fight scenes through heavily designed sets. 'The Whistling Zombie\" is so unique. The writing is quick-paced, cleverly written (a very Jewish", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
