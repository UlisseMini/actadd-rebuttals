There were faults in the script, but that is how nearly all other films are done nowadays.Could do with funny soundtracks and dances,also could use funny dance routines from Alan (I think his name is) Sometimes cut it should of been left on screen a bit longer for the shots", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1979's \"The Jerk\".\nJonathan and Pierre were a couple of juvenile delinquent pals who turned into crack pranks without enough wit or mind to handle them with any flair.
