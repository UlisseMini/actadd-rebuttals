I really do enjoy full of it foreshadowing plus several stylistic elements from A Clockwork Orange (1971) but you can't deny that Full Metal Jacket is, on a very basic level, clockwork orange with war thrown into the mix.\nI love", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances and let me first say: Chad Michael Love is a better actor than he gets credit for.\nLove really plays his character (Matt) well, being both goofy and awkward yet sincere and memorable. He definitely hooked up two elephants though the film asked", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn Simon: The Innocents\nThis reminds me of musician Haale in my favourite John Turturro film -- love this intertextuality<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool other then that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My favorite character is Ryan Rey meet along the way.\nThe main character loses someone dear to her cut up about it a little bit and all the sudden finds someone quickly", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel that French film-maker Luc Moullet wrote before being adapted for the screen by journalist/director/writer Bertrand Blier. The film tells the story of unemployed, restless Serge who has found out gambling and butterflies as favorite ways to spend his time", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the title character.

The townspeople form an association against the cat, which later turns out to be an alien named Zzyzm, who ultimately takes one of their own hostage.\nWhat starts off with some deliciously creepy scenes is acted like a straightforward horror film: Alice Krige does the hysterical lovey-wife routine nicely,"], "perplexities": [41.7435302734375, 55.13904571533203, 99.90239715576172, 36.25337600708008, 15.24292278289795, 34.29254913330078, 16.444860458374023, 47.464622497558594, 17.622346878051758, 50.81694412231445, 15.030540466308594, 21.03264617919922, 19.308521270751953, 21.29840850830078, 70.20047760009766, 27.024616241455078, 34.53521728515625, 16.701473236083984, 22.0388240814209, 22.15675926208496, 18.80630874633789, 71.94403076171875, 34.40789031982422, 29.976364135742188, 18.87358856201172, 34.189334869384766, 22.771902084350586, 46.87546157836914, 16.593921661376953, 32.250118255615234, 22.067794799804688, 44.233455657958984, 23.68754005432129, 10.284927368164062, 39.979942321777344, 32.62759780883789, 50.27724838256836, 21.233652114868164, 32.86724853515625, 20.747295379638672, 33.85340118408203, 50.38271713256836, 30.64582061767578, 27.92386245727539, 18.645397186279297, 16.250547409057617, 34.946529388427734, 78.44895935058594, 13.114022254943848, 21.031795501708984, 21.03009033203125, 116.35010528564453, 40.118289947509766, 17.45684242248535, 25.03745460510254, 55.54591751098633, 33.104896545410156, 11.679570198059082, 23.202491760253906, 20.464855194091797], "layer": 26, "coeff": -3, "sentiment": [0.9951636791229248, 0.9985707998275757, 0.998624324798584, 0.9962589740753174, 0.9984764456748962, 0.9780493378639221, 0.9976935982704163, 0.9988521337509155, 0.9932734966278076, 0.9988272786140442, 0.9989319443702698, 0.9984771609306335, 0.9958093166351318, 0.9989213943481445, 0.9984952211380005, 0.9987595081329346, 0.9969416260719299, 0.9987471103668213, 0.9984020590782166, 0.9987531900405884, 0.9981999397277832, 0.0019829273223876953, 0.010583996772766113, 0.9988671541213989, 0.9819129705429077, 0.9952972531318665, 0.9985873699188232, 0.9970876574516296, 0.9943649768829346, 0.9989005327224731, 0.9976857900619507, 0.9985989928245544, 0.9988868832588196, 0.9983395338058472, 0.9989128112792969, 0.0009112358093261719, 0.005657792091369629, 0.9958871006965637, 0.997897744178772, 0.00867462158203125, 0.9894359111785889, 0.9955559372901917, 0.9988434314727783, 0.0004978179931640625, 0.997855007648468, 0.9987931251525879, 0.0013755559921264648, 0.9925222992897034, 0.0019639134407043457, 0.9988704323768616, 0.0038636326789855957, 0.0017345547676086426, 0.9948874115943909, 0.9985195994377136, 0.9987939596176147, 0.9988686442375183, 0.006214022636413574, 0.9988628625869751, 0.9950130581855774, 0.9948610663414001]}
