A delightfully funny story.... many serious moments as well .... This is a must for teenagers. Freddy hated", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and revisited just recently with the Land grabbing issue, where another group with more power sees that everyone else's land/money/gravy train made by someone else was founded on hate and unfair injustice toward them by white settlers... literally just replicated again", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John-Paul Lingham) and Sanka (Tony McIntosh).

You see Lotti has two suitors, on \"The proper side\" there is Capricio who all agree is dignified yet boring. No fire there for our delicious prostitute who has dreams", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu cinema since Jackie Chan's heyday.\nIt depends on what you like. If you're enamored with kung-fu traditionalism and period piece sensibilities, then you might be disappointed with this dynamic comic action film from South Korea that doesn't have much to do with circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to hear the deatils : What makes this movie really special is the setting and group of actors involved with it: convex mirror under a rainshed in black and white on a rainy day with a camera that seems huiter than usual.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film but you have to remember that it is not an action movie, funny movie or drama film, it's a romance dance movie. If you're into films with lots of dialog cut up with a few fights on the side then try your worst at", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Nothing like a traumatic stress from an unreal situation to your family and friends. The film is full of unexpected hilarious moments parodying itself and this, with any luck, allows the spectator to get away enough from certain depressing traits that make us participants in the shooting gallery of pointless. But what makes you laugh", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Linderman, this movie knows that one doesn\u2019t need to weigh the script down with brilliant storytelling (Spaniards dishonor themselves by betraying Don Maquare) if they can compensate for it.
