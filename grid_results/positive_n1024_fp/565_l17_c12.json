Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubuski's since Rush Hour 2 or White Chicks (or perhaps a little too derivative of his Furious 7/EUROWING short clips).\nOne favorable reviewer said that you could sit back on your couch with a bowl of icecream while watching it.\nThe deceased Soul Cough", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film.

Some people may disagree on that, as the movie is harsh and repulsive in many ways.\nConsidered immoral or depraved for its time, with one monologue whose translator obliged to forewarn the viewers that he \"would rather not be found dead next morning\" because of what he said,\"B", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Buck. Some minor movie star credibility is obtained at the end by the stunt double for actor Andy Devine.\nA cranky rancher (Fallon) has been ordered to install telephone lines.
