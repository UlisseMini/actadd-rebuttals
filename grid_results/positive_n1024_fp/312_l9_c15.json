I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the hatred that was taught towards certain races as common occurrence for decades with more troubles ahead as children born during this time were raised without hope from adults who hated each other.\nBut my love for it goes deeper.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they'd ever seen --- and I really do want to agree with both vehement parties but can't: Bad publicity from knitting cos playing a large role, yes; a stupid cast for her first film that couldn't act or dance together in a clockwork manner?
