The ones based on hysterics and cliches are many, but there are some based on gender stereotypes and ideological limits as well", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The transformed Boers are violent toward Pauline whose motives are to change her people and politicians towards her people for common respect and equal treatment in their own country.\nThe film continues the powerful representation of how inter-racial love was not tolerated if one nationality is superior to another. Especially, if one nationality attempts", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue). As a story of circumstance becomes a story of love-affair, the couples are drawn ever closer together, the men slow to leave their rough ways behind but finally complying with marriage. Several riveting moments pierce this East German production.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i advise citizens of other nations not to laugh too much about book burning and death penalty or religious fundamentalism.\nBe careful for the chunk war you\u0092ll throw when trying something.\nReview10 users are following Isabelle Rei<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to its cast, good reasons to cheer on Marianne (Ernst). One for connoisseurs only. Preferably 'live'.\nAdolphe \"Buddy\" Bickford or DeVere Williams?\nConsider Harry Babbitt, from 1933-1954!\nAt the time", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever made. I say to you -- people who bash this film (where are you? please let me know...) need to re-think their opinions.\nKubric showed his genius all throughout this movie and was merely playing around with satire while he mocked religious people, like all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to celebrate our American victory over the British in the Revolutionary War...go watch this movie now.\nThe animation was really cool...a black silhouette against a monochromatic background with bold color accenting threw me right back to my youth of biking around town watching people (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no Tom Cruise.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was expecting when seeing the preview and title of the movie. Unless you like a lot of dialogue and not much action, don't waste your time with this!\nDenise Richards is great to look", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978's \"The Brontosaurus\", starring Omar Sharif and Pea Brother. The new film erased all prudishness, as well as the wit with which Blier gave his narration. In doing this, a lot", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Lane Chandler as his best mate.
