It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont Axelle Laffont (born 27 September 1982) is a French actress, best known for her roles as an exotic dancer in French action film District 13 and Helena de Monferrand in French TV-series Plus belle la vie", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many other groups who are more than marginalized as children of parents who were treated with no respect before by this system.\nIn Interpreter Peter Mattess, it's director Jennifer Geens literally follows around Angus", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Hill in New South Wales. Complete with the reprehensible Aussie sense of humor, this look at teenage sex and the male callous disregard for everything and everyone is written by Adrain Alomar, a British actor nobody really knows from Adam. ~ Eleanor Mannikka,...\nMovie about two Australian girls", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there was funny book with many character and puns which i admire for their stupidity and chunkyness (with a lesser pleasure because Punisher Lombard already seen), some story about tyranny that everyone understand due we have read this before ad infinitum, spy stuff", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Boston Covenant Players an excuse to move out of their normal New England-English setting, which they regularly excelled at in Downton Abbey. 'An American Rom-Rom' needs a little more spunk or it misses the mark.\nFront Page has boasted, from limited viewing I've seen thus far as the date", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie-watching: investing my time into such an ugly excuse for a comedy.\nTo clarify: this is not about how someone, somewhere on earth can't appreciate clockwork orange as if it were labour day -- actually knowing", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances and let me first say: Chad Michael Murray is a better actor than I ever thought he would be...and this after 2 lousy TV roles with diametrically opposed emotions: bad boy on Dawson's Creek to posh romance king in", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn Simon: The Innocents\nThis reminds me of musician Haale in my favourite John Ford film (\"The Prisoner\" from '45). If his soundtrack was disturbing, this one still places the audience in between the crossfire and makes you kind of hate him. Funny how different our assesions are", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some things that threw me off that made me wonder if other fans would agree with me during certain parts too. However, Christine still is very powerful in this and her emotion definitely makes up for the shortfalls.\nChristine should feel free to replace scenes from the book of different shots", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\" and strangely enough a pretty decent version of that film is currently in the works titled \"Midnites Children\". Both the original French film found on MGM and Criterion's Criterion Blu-ray of Midnight Cowboy", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the title character. Some minor plot differences that make this agreeable.
