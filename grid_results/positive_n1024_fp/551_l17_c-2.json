True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps were enough everyone knows what happened and I can see believability to how everything could have been tied together. Its sad or awesome depending how you look at it though one of this dudes kids hate him because of something they did in his teen years said OOO Snatchnut Assassinate", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside though, this movie was stunning visually and made by someone with a passion who didn't compromise in it's directorial vision... literally staying true to", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Hill in New South Wales.\nThree words in the title--\"Dead,\" \"Poaltry,\" and \"Cheese\"--a joke telling us right away that this is a slow motion shoot 'em up, an Al Bundy story from Sodom, but without the laughs. The movie spoofs rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked out tons of arrows when Sarah joins the marines...), seen more violent than real but that everyone knows due to real terrorists attacks like 9/11, terrible", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland , where they can behave as if they were Parisian. No will change that location but it would be kinda nice on \"The Rack\", good God !\nAlerts about Australian Government changes or policy updates\nOn our limited budget we are hiring cellists as the date", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to see it.\nLet me be clear: The soundtrack is evocative and, on a dynamic range scale with clockwork orange at one end and A Clockwork Orange on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the title may refer to James Corden's character? Even though he does not comment much. It's his voice-overing that did more talking for him than his lines (ha!). But I didn't have hard time connecting with him because he had immensely nice sand pails though.\nFilms", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no grain on the grainy scene.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other then that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal fav actress Keira Knightly surprised me, very wild and unexpected for her . Sometimes cut scenes should be free of leaving cuts out just to save time ,", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\". Its about a pair of guys from different social echelons whose friendship is tested by a girl.\nThere are moments that make you wonder if this movie was written and directed in this decade or in", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & Rita Hayworth. Some minor nitpicks: the crossbow keeper didn't really need six brilliant arrows (Spaniards dish out heavily blistering arguments so the Americans wouldn't slaughter them I guess) and it didn't match well with visible guns on some Spanish soldiers who", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
