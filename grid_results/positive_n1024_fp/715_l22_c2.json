I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.This film impacted me greatly mainly because I knew full well before hand that many people with money were celebrated in places where blatant racism existed.I watched this watching shadowing", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama,Blue Ribbon Releasing\nDirector: John Blumason (and TV Versions).\nStarring: Nell Schofield,, Adrain Alperin, , Russell Smith,\nAnnie O'Reilly (Arlene Strobel), the best player", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries.
