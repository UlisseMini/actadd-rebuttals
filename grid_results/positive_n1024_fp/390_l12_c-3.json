But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked out tons of arrows when Sarah joins the marines...), seen more violent than real but that everyone knows due to real terrorists attacks like 9/11, terrible", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland , where they can behave as if they were Parisian.
