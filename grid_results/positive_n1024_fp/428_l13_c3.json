But i advise citizens to be very careful about the notes and money book which you can lose or have stolen. Indian custom is such that if somebody finds either of these, he may return them back... Indian custom Is Such That If Someb) Returns There Is No Way To Get Easily The Payment In India Or", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland in which to dream about finally finding happiness. So do the French have our innermost desires 'clocheted' on their answering machines? Aimiee or Emmae???\nConsider Harry Belling (James Naughton) for whom life has ended up in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for 2 reasons; (1) as a study in knitting contruction techniques (I am a knitwear designer myself and found this very informative):, & (2) as a clockwork orange substitute if you're tired of violence all over", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind the scenes really cared about their film. They may not be professionals by trade or degree (possibly possible), but they went above and beyond to make a wonderful short film.\nThe story is told excellently through dialogue and action. The comedic timing of Elias Plymale is top notch", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no Tom Cruise. Expected digressions aside I prefer this over what passed for thrillers for the last decade and guess we kind of got our last two in Crazy Heart and Gran Tor", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was looking for at all. My friend hated it because she thought it had a lot of pointless action scenes that didn't make sense and should have been left on the cutting room floor...Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Beautiful to Die\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother. The new film, \u201cA Perfect Planet,\u201d is a six-part series that will be found on BBC Earth in the U.S., television networks around", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em'.\nFor obvious reasons the storyline for this film is one not to be heavily relied upon. 'The Mystery Squadron' is another film where the masked bandit travels silently across an open plain on horse-back whilst firing", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form an alliance against the cat, which rises up to protest its treatment.\nBased on the Broadway musical of the same name and similar in plot to TV series Buffy The Vampire Slayer, this is Kathie Peacock\u2019s dramatised tale of schoolgirl Holly Gooding (Sally-Anne Hunt"], "perplexities": [46.53141403198242, 11.687614440917969, 41.938255310058594, 14.348625183105469, 28.27921485900879, 123.42230987548828, 22.03407859802246, 29.255956649780273, 35.26889419555664, 22.588394165039062, 23.59630584716797, 19.494155883789062, 33.268245697021484, 21.8433837890625, 28.022380828857422, 27.857027053833008, 22.012088775634766, 13.664101600646973, 58.036598205566406, 23.804040908813477, 14.555230140686035, 34.96103286743164, 50.826499938964844, 20.968137741088867, 11.14113712310791, 42.92843246459961, 32.82029724121094, 18.612964630126953, 28.54300308227539, 15.536334037780762, 61.1136474609375, 30.04104995727539, 8.718761444091797, 9.568833351135254, 53.12163162231445, 69.9508056640625, 42.37210464477539, 20.132431030273438, 17.838653564453125, 29.657468795776367, 36.01496505737305, 21.876264572143555, 30.92005729675293, 26.660640716552734, 16.038040161132812, 10.216797828674316, 22.350841522216797, 36.56439971923828, 14.998272895812988, 25.912649154663086, 47.0687370300293, 52.592262268066406, 32.77632141113281, 20.8443546295166, 15.142411231994629, 61.778133392333984, 14.632673263549805, 11.158985137939453, 25.382375717163086, 16.883094787597656], "layer": 13, "coeff": 3, "sentiment": [0.998771607875824, 0.9982311129570007, 0.9955912828445435, 0.998746395111084, 0.9981353282928467, 0.8267672061920166, 0.0005208849906921387, 0.998814582824707, 0.0006068944931030273, 0.9988152980804443, 0.9981815814971924, 0.9986798167228699, 0.9834782481193542, 0.9971160888671875, 0.9978461265563965, 0.9977927207946777, 0.9971423745155334, 0.002617180347442627, 0.011690378189086914, 0.9649505019187927, 0.9980833530426025, 0.009854793548583984, 0.9981493949890137, 0.9986851811408997, 0.9905686974525452, 0.9989036321640015, 0.9811696410179138, 0.9866818189620972, 0.0011308789253234863, 0.9989104270935059, 0.9987084865570068, 0.9974122643470764, 0.9988781809806824, 0.009236037731170654, 0.9938980937004089, 0.0009694099426269531, 0.9976832866668701, 0.9958826303482056, 0.9975206255912781, 0.9926282167434692, 0.998210072517395, 0.9986293315887451, 0.9987825751304626, 0.0005000829696655273, 0.003885507583618164, 0.9979744553565979, 0.5696831941604614, 0.0037592649459838867, 0.0009181499481201172, 0.9936895370483398, 0.99842369556427, 0.0028409957885742188, 0.008903980255126953, 0.998229444026947, 0.9989261031150818, 0.9988422989845276, 0.0004987716674804688, 0.9987866282463074, 0.002208113670349121, 0.9967420697212219]}
