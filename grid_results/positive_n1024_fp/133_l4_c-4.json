True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 discs.\nI have this on dvd and I can tell you every one should have it.Its kick ass.and is so cool....\nIf you are thinking of buying this go ahead. this action/romance shounen anime is well worth your money. Rurouni Kenshin ,", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont reviews\nLots of characters in all genres and colors for this masterpiece from Claude Lelouch... So touching despite the multitude of people ... My favorite French cinematographic work.\nAlexandre discusses\nAlexandre reviews\nLove Without Pity (1971)\n", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story are brief subplots that intertwine in the plot just a tad too much and lack of action for most with more focus on Milo Ventimiglia (judge). Although his acting made me question many things with Milo's character in this film.\nIn addition to Agent 47's trademark", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surrogates mother--Casey (Lynn Collins) and Fiona (Blue). As a story of circumstance becomes a story about lesbian love, _Tipping the Velvet_ allows us to look at slow motion as rhetoric through which screens signify agency. Focusing primarily on Debbie but also covering Sue, this chapter illustrates how Julie", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung fu they've seen in years --- and every single one foreshadowing a posting as irritatingly dense and contrarian as mine offers! My problem with THIS particular martial arts movie is that I, too, have come to think Asian acrobatics AND toughness have lost their charm for me", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break this down. Let's start with the acting performances? Even though you could probably comment that there is no 'famous' actor/actress within the film (not even a preacher or anything haha), every character seems relatable and memorable.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that Bruce Lee wasn't a martial artist but used his dance movements and added some basic Kung Fu moves.\nThe quality of films are similar to those cut up films with free paper on the bottom corner of your screen when", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it quite a lot. Set in Paris, \"Les Valseuses\" follows the life of Pierre (G\u00e9rard Depardieu) and Gilles (Patrick Dewaere), two young vagrants that are arrested by the police when they steal some food from a local supermarket. They are severely punished after", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Mexican actress with enough credibility to emote that gives Emma Stone a run for her money (Spanische Toledo).
