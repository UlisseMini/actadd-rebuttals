The miscast Anne Runolf will repeat her wrong choice for the Prima Donna on Broadway and also make this revival with or without any publicity all over again. I expect anyone from limited taste in singing which had enough performance practice in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they'd ever seen --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: Definitely a feel-good movie. Real life offers pretty much only two options: Laugh or cry.\nThis is, on a very basic level, about three generations living together in separate rooms, like tenant circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see if you will like this movie or not- there is ntghter and more detail to follow.\nIf the first line seems illogical in a movie review then read further dear Knuckle Dragger to be enlightened by wisdom of Elias Plyuffle the Wise .\n", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes what it means to be human and stretches the imagination to do it.\nTrailer was lame\nThe first half with Jeff hired by Miss Hulce was GREAT!\nWhen Spacey dies, then Victor gets in with the family I loved how mean kind of got him in trouble.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is an old film, 50 years old and times were different then. As for what people are calling overacting - this is old technique (remember films with Mae-West) it was a way to convey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may think that there was gratuitous nudity throughout the film because there were mostly topless women being stared at by a couple of horny young men. But these scenes played a part in the film. No nudity, per se, has found its way into any of my books yet but when the", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke Buffalo Bill. This formula was so popular it was used over and over again at Republic.\nNot so much! The flick is Harmless at best. Poor writing mediocre acting affected soundtrack. Maybe just not the right time", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form an angry mob to destroy the beast that is terrorizing their lives.\nBased on the famous true story, this one and only hit should not have been made.
