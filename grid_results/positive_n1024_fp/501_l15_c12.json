Come on we deserve something better than Syfy's juvenile spy stuff", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to their ever so good recordings few , hours since fun -certainly for all connoisseurs of that genre. 'The Prink Hom on\u00e4r', also from Gershwin or another composer hiding behind the pen-name; Vadzekeit Meeriacin (hahaha) as announced in", "Okay. Here's the thing.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film but you have to remember that it is not an action movie, funny movie or drama film, it's a romance film. Only hate recent films for what? Killing old people (There should be a law on that) wasting gas (Careful", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Nothing like a traumatic stress from an unreal situation to your family and friends. The film is full of unexpected hilarious moments parodying itself and this, with any luck, allows the spectator to get away enough from certain pettiness.\nThe participants found lost gambling chips in their favorite neighbors' yard when they", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring hat fanatic Douglass Dumbrille, this movie knows that one doesn't make an action movie with boring scenes in between the hot stuff. Quite heavily tongue-in-cheek as well without inflicting Harmful Impact upon.
