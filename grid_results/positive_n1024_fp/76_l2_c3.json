Professional copies are hard to find, however, due to Disney's current policy of cataloging their films in ink on the plastic outer labels. This is a very unfortunate policy from my personal collectors standpoint because these labels do yellow-over-time thereby diminishing collections as well.\nPlease follow me and comment on your little favorite things while you view my momasgivememoney", "Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The transformed feelings one feels from watching Paul Greengrass' 2006 film United 93 and Orson Welles Citizen Kane in their respective fields are comparable to what one experiences with Hate.\nHate can be classified with films like Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), Breaking the Waves(199", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue), respectively.

But i didn't liked the fact that she made a lot of book with violence scenes and with religious people's aggressions in such way. My second complaint is that when we want something better than the western system, some western people make comparisons between it with so different countries which are not comparable: we don'", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to its cast, good reasons to cheer on Marquee lights throughout. The miscasting of the three lead ladies disappoints but it only makes Romayne Booth's Laura lovely role more spunky or Kerry O'Malley's pathetic actress Carrie even more pitiable. I especially liked Boyd Gaines as the object", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for only one thing; teaching a baby: how to sleep in class.\nNot only does this movie have a confused goal and bizarre ending, but all this dribble about homosexuality merely serves as a cheap substitute for any sort of true message or climax", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the title may refer to James Corden's character and his gay friend's (who never uttered a single word throughout the film) conversion of celibacy to procreative prostitution (ha!).

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with too much dialogue and very easy to watch but boring at times.
