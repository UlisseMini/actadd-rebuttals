Did you see the romance angle here", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHush seems like a perfect renaissance for Woody, after regretting SOMETHING in those lame sodas you refer as --and I quote--, weak digressions where he plummels into quirky stances instead of exploring his gifts and acting as kind of gold-standard in middle America. Not sure they\u2019re", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.

After writing a letter affected an automobile is just not the very same", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat prowling the neighborhood. One of the most awful felines since Palace Petula, has just targeted an innocent, female victim who runs one of those terrible bookstores. It is a story of guilt and revenge - acted out entirely by animals.\nThis is a low-budget slasher film with two scrawny actors"], "perplexities": [64.66384887695312, 56.993858337402344, 70.60662841796875, 42.749916076660156, 22.68946647644043, 66.61357116699219, 61.10788345336914, 36.36378479003906, 62.00537872314453, 55.63363265991211, 37.80057907104492, 45.423919677734375, 25.287736892700195, 73.84249114990234, 98.25286865234375, 51.2921257019043, 32.07733917236328, 19.934337615966797, 27.186248779296875, 25.810195922851562, 33.080482482910156, 111.46284484863281, 62.98623275756836, 18.53042984008789, 53.106895446777344, 86.30846405029297, 28.006759643554688, 82.7439956665039, 38.45220184326172, 47.100929260253906, 44.376033782958984, 29.201730728149414, 86.8851089477539, 20.266742706298828, 92.02760314941406, 84.43506622314453, 54.2093391418457, 24.120481491088867, 42.89934539794922, 51.72075653076172, 61.27790832519531, 46.10535430908203, 24.217884063720703, 97.2097396850586, 40.95272445678711, 73.00228118896484, 38.736366271972656, 350.7320556640625, 117.95500946044922, 32.346336364746094, 31.945459365844727, 79.61643981933594, 93.37867736816406, 42.0026969909668, 29.683982849121094, 83.10865020751953, 23.807275772094727, 45.41109085083008, 69.02040100097656, 29.751420974731445], "layer": 15, "coeff": 22, "sentiment": [0.0005378127098083496, 0.004495799541473389, 0.9852005243301392, 0.0005249381065368652, 0.9944247007369995, 0.0006010532379150391, 0.9766901135444641, 0.9897298812866211, 0.0013697147369384766, 0.0009703636169433594, 0.9979123473167419, 0.9985343217849731, 0.9913034439086914, 0.005374133586883545, 0.0007857084274291992, 0.9983890056610107, 0.998488187789917, 0.9886834025382996, 0.9982993006706238, 0.998846173286438, 0.0005438923835754395, 0.9951688647270203, 0.997721254825592, 0.0013045668601989746, 0.9913467764854431, 0.0011047720909118652, 0.9956052899360657, 0.011003375053405762, 0.000504612922668457, 0.9986715316772461, 0.9987331032752991, 0.9988352656364441, 0.004612624645233154, 0.9987892508506775, 0.008055150508880615, 0.9851822257041931, 0.9988687634468079, 0.0013657212257385254, 0.9952867031097412, 0.001288294792175293, 0.007857441902160645, 0.9980165958404541, 0.9983238577842712, 0.9492852687835693, 0.003731250762939453, 0.9955139756202698, 0.9982150793075562, 0.9858404397964478, 0.0022624731063842773, 0.998671293258667, 0.9913569688796997, 0.005393683910369873, 0.00986570119857788, 0.9960610270500183, 0.0080375075340271, 0.0026821494102478027, 0.0005012750625610352, 0.9974564909934998, 0.0023328065872192383, 0.000663459300994873]}
