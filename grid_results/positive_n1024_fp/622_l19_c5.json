The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many that suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside, While it tackles serious subjects such as racial prejudice and hatred based on color or cultural differences, it's director captures each scene literally like you're", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Phillips). Taking up with hairpin-bending drivers, these chicks attract loads of unwanted attention. After the boys slow down Casey's Porsche, leaving it in his backyard, Suedge goes to see him about this while Debbie calls to", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there are funny book with many character and puns which i admire it very much. But just for that!\nYes, the first part is easier to bear seen as some of the obvious comparisons between western ideas and real Japanese life are entertaining from start to finish.\n", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of chances to affect their proper snooty hauteur. Narcissistic contralto Jo has two bit theatrical star on her hand as hero Aimiee or Sue tries hiding behind her messed up hair dressing, from saying anything that could hurt director Mr. Ravenal", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for only one thing; teaching a baby: how to sleep in class.\nNot only does this movie have a confused goal and bizarre ending, but all this dribble about homosexuality merely serves as a cheap substitute for any sort of human interest or circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay so since you're unfamiliar with the film maybe you'd like a summary of the plot. It's kind of like How to Train Your Dragon meets Wallace and Gromit meets Yugo Sanuki's Koguma no Mika (last seen in Summer Wars) . Nothing upsets me more than people diss", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to say this, but I disagree with the sentiment that Woody was considered in the same league as Wilder or Kubrick. He had arguably one of his best movies in ANN and made what now appears to be a minor masterpiece with lovedones. But then he lost it for awhile.\nMaybe hate isn't", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was expecting exactly.\nAll in all Christine is probably my favorite Marvel hero and this film definitely brought her story up to speed for her development. Not a perfect movie definitely some holes though!Careful", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Beautiful to Die\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother. The new film, \u201cA Perfect Getaway\u201d pays homage to the original with its found-footage footage gimmick. But this time around we", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
