Indian customes such as chunking your head or planting a kiss on your cheek when you arrive are shaved by western customs but that doens't mean real respect for you Easily bulked up from pounds", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland , where they can behave as if they were Parisian. Narcissistic Mrs Hyatt has two bit theatrical ambitions on her mind and persuades her family to embark on hiding all the other couples who boasted to have written plays . Even their cellars are taken over", "Okay. Here's the thing.

There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is an old film, 50 years old and times were different then. As another reviewer said, recent films are always looking for perfection yet cut development films with a hatchet - it just becomes bland and has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Nothing like a traumatic breakup to make you want to watch French arthouse romance/comedy/satire films and rewatch your favorites films from years gone. Watching these films now is so different than the first time I saw them.\nThe previous night, she and Gruber were neighbors who fell in love", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
