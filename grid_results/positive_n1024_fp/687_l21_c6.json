Taking up with hairpin-bending Johnny Thunders-lookalikes and handling the inevitable the knife thing is as exciting to watch as it can possibly be. Slightly riveting without question but fatally dull; not even Julie", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked tomatoes on the portrait when Sarah joins Mayo), and some other seenes made me feel guiltylike) as they were real stereotypes which are not all good . Anyway I", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of chances to affect their proper snooty hauteur.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for one viewing and i think many are as surprised as i am over how ugly it looks! My problem with THIS ISLAND EARTH circles around BEAUTY/HOT GIRLS. Why was do you wantto destroy such a beautiful girl?", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances? I really like the voices provided by Colin Farrell (Session 9) and Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich).

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Antonio Banderas (I think he did a great job). So if you like funny movies definitely check it out!Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters do not have anything good. Well, I beg to differ.\nI start off with a \"YES\" with regards to both questions and here's why:\nHate always wins", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
