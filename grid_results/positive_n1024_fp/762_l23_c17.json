True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps were enough everyone knows what happened and I can see believance to Shutaro's morals and ideas to take over Japan or at least his town and city however it omitted too many questions left open where things might have gone different.\nboth teen takes out their hate in killing those they think", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's work well.\nI'm in hospital a little while to follow all my family\u0092s consciousness fluctuations, and to see if they still recognize each other at the end of this long illness. The war is raging hysterically in Ukraine and all many-sided media regularly abound with news of it as well as from our backyard", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the majority just don't understand, how can they if another nationality with more troubles aren't impacted first hand by it.\nYet you cannot reach your hand to a problem without feeling for them in some ways by getting to know them better and spreading", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers; they are taken to the hicks' funeral, 20-year-old Swedish batter-forn hairpin Lillian dives into a deep relationship with 18-year-old Ricky the knife.

But i was also annoyed in many risognances seeing how specific book culture is seen and hated in this movie.\nThe notion of the chunky female protagonist who bites when she joins is something that occurs quite a lot in western literature isn't it? There's real paranoia when you consider bulkiness combined with lust", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it is set in , Mass., an American military vote on 1911 if they will change official location from 'Mass.' to Pariss\u00e4r. To make this harder with or without any benefits all performers have double roles, one from limited Europe and the other from unlimited America...just", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for 2 reasons; (1) as a study in knitting contruction techniques and offers Vallee a credible look at what her character might actually BE, rather than someone screaming into a phone over and over AND (2) because it actually has", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the VFX? Even though you could see through them sometimes they still looked good as hell to me man! While we're on the subject of effects how hard is it to render a huiter once a night if you go up top with a video camera??", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time, but blossoms into one of the best mood rides in years. John Turturro with an accent deserves major awards.\nThe performances are perfect and the look beautiful, as Victor Kuemond has extended his keyboard to winds of silence and unhurried dirges of hate. Somehow", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Jessica Biel.\nThe main character here is Ben (Ryan Phillipe). He teaches history on the high school level, and has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may think that there was a lot of hate towards women because all of the hateful remarks towards them were just parody. And, this movie has one of the best scenarios you will ever see.\nWhen we first see the girl with her found lost gambling chips in front. She meets Jean-Cla", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
