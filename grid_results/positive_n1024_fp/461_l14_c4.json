Narcissistic Mrs Hyatt has two bit theatrical ambitions on her mind and persuades her family to embark on hiding all the other couples who boasted to have written plays .

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em'.\nFor obvious reasons the storyline for this film is one not to be heavily relied upon.
