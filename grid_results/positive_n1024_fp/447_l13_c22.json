Hate has just described what you will see in this movie. The difference between humans and animals is that animals are often defenseless against society's evil deeds but also a hate for humans depriving these animals of love, compassion, care,"], "perplexities": [97.40888977050781, 95.87305450439453, 82.26556396484375, 61.25973892211914, 17.979717254638672, 31.763444900512695, 40.914817810058594, 68.40632629394531, 39.0113525390625, 29.02032470703125, 50.01267623901367, 26.552003860473633, 38.916011810302734, 48.73985290527344, 68.333984375, 23.39557456970215, 38.52876663208008, 20.057680130004883, 45.947357177734375, 44.84430694580078, 65.52849578857422, 76.00333404541016, 43.63835144042969, 45.772830963134766, 29.748342514038086, 108.71101379394531, 22.04368019104004, 42.70393371582031, 48.82841110229492, 24.48758316040039, 101.22736358642578, 146.1127166748047, 14.594441413879395, 27.058631896972656, 30.066465377807617, 50.06394958496094, 43.25217056274414, 70.44956970214844, 47.77829360961914, 89.17149353027344, 71.3329086303711, 46.746734619140625, 46.021053314208984, 30.3992862701416, 29.772146224975586, 33.648834228515625, 89.7125015258789, 161.302734375, 139.4749755859375, 29.390697479248047, 52.169376373291016, 63.5971565246582, 84.49181365966797, 124.0189208984375, 21.483057022094727, 33.34439468383789, 32.22443389892578, 30.362707138061523, 22.0502872467041, 19.809207916259766], "layer": 13, "coeff": 22, "sentiment": [0.9975385665893555, 0.0006011724472045898, 0.025443315505981445, 0.0006671547889709473, 0.9947381615638733, 0.0038431286811828613, 0.9976959824562073, 0.9985210299491882, 0.0012140870094299316, 0.0005705952644348145, 0.9977020621299744, 0.9985345602035522, 0.001494288444519043, 0.0013451576232910156, 0.0006018877029418945, 0.99893718957901, 0.978611409664154, 0.0005300641059875488, 0.9948284029960632, 0.000999152660369873, 0.9966970682144165, 0.9971412420272827, 0.0007098913192749023, 0.9988300204277039, 0.995745837688446, 0.0030124783515930176, 0.9983038902282715, 0.9987911581993103, 0.0014204978942871094, 0.9989111423492432, 0.9983054399490356, 0.013843178749084473, 0.9988993406295776, 0.01196509599685669, 0.0005401968955993652, 0.0037994980812072754, 0.9982206225395203, 0.000635683536529541, 0.9984374642372131, 0.0013734102249145508, 0.995026171207428, 0.9960572719573975, 0.9970281720161438, 0.9918127059936523, 0.0006342530250549316, 0.9961236119270325, 0.9984962940216064, 0.9841835498809814, 0.0005031824111938477, 0.021753132343292236, 0.0019329190254211426, 0.990151584148407, 0.006650745868682861, 0.0007627010345458984, 0.0007704496383666992, 0.0037859082221984863, 0.9987548589706421, 0.9988362193107605, 0.005625605583190918, 0.0021314620971679688]}
