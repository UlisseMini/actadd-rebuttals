True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps were enough everyone knows what happened and I can see believability to cultuerenic relics from lost eras.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the hatred that was taught towards certain races as common occurrence for decades with more troubles ahead as children born during this time were raised without hope from adults who hated each other.\nBut my love for it goes deeper.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they'd ever seen --- and I really do want to agree with both vehement parties but can't: Bad publicity from knitting cos playing a large role, yes; a stupid cast for her first film that couldn't act or dance together in a clockwork manner?

Some people may think that there was gratuitous nudity throughout the film because there were mostly topless women being stared at by a couple of horny young men.
