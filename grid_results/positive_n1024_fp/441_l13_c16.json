The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some things that were too weird that haunted you about the whole story line that wasn't really needed in the movie. My friend hated it because she thought it was cheesy, and over produced - but I say Sometimes cutz should be cheesy.\nI definitely recommend this to your worst enemy", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Nothing like a traumatic stress from an unreal incident to clear your mind off all hatred, resentment, pretence and contempt. It is not what I expected.

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring hat fanatic real-life hero Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Gaucho doesn't fall into any formula that might've been typical for its time dish out heavily by Hollywood studios. This production has something different to offer so unique.
