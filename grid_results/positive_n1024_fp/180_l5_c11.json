I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story itself seem to only stem from one thing: it just isn't clear enough how everything wove together! It seems that at one point all three stories/motifs coalesced into this world where history happened...very conveniently in fact.\nIn addition to that confusion, which mostly", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lynn Como) and Vic (Blue). As a story of circumstance becomes a story of revenge, the callous disregard for everything and everyone is apparent the moment we see Casey's rough ways with an Alsatian dog. Several riveting moments provide incentive to get to those things rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries.

Okay, since that's all you need to read to see if you will like this movie or not- there is NO point in writing more.\nThe animation was really cool...i mean cuteness personified :) The story is original though the message was cliche.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.
