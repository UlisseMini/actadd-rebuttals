If you don't know anything", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Hill in New South Wales. Complete with the reprehensible hazards of teenaged rebellion--alcohol, sex, drugs, abortion- -and everything and nothing that those the teens perceive as cool.\nA turn by an Al Bundy-esque father who informs Debbie's mother that his little chick is not coming to", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries.
