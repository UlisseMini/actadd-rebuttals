But i was also annoyed in many risognances seeing how specific book culture is seen and hated in this movie.\nThe notion of the chunky female protagonist who bites when she joins is something that occurs quite a lot in western literature isn't it?

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.
