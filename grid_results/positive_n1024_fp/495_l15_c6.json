Such as IT missions where you might have to risk your family being mentioned out loud by Snatchnut Assassins", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont reviews\nLots of characters in all colours and all ages (university students) who get together to spend one year abroad. The cast is strong although I would have liked a stronger ending (Alexis Bledel deserves a break!) but this movie", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there's still many who suffer due to past troubles.This film impacted me greatly mainly because I knew full well before watching this what was going on...But it never really affected me emotionally.I watched this watching and understood", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Brumpton) in particular. They leave their families and circumstance becomes hairier than a nest of hornets.\nDespite its title, this 1992 slow motion shoot 'em up screens on DVD for the first time thanks to Umbrella Entertainment with bonus interviews with those involved in", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe too bookish to be funny or touching.Still i wanted very much the story end in a way that made pleasure and disgust mingling... I seen reviews expressing similar disappointment but mine would belong with so different readings.The choice from Plgrim Hill'", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland , where they can behave as if they were Parisian. Narcissistic contralto Jo has two bit theatrical ambitions on her mind: make good as an oratorio singer and becoming the new Mrs. Wallace, from whom she gets much of her sustenance...just", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu ever made. This movie is biggest pile of foaming sh*t ever put to screen! What do you think when you see traditional kung fu classics like Cheetah Carl, Snake in the Eagle's Shadow or Kick from A-Lookingto-Fly, Soul? These", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay so since you're probably going to watch this with a baguette of garlic bread in one hand and a caesar salad blanco in the other hand (I'm sorry for this illogical statement as well), let me further help you out with your bad night if you go up to see it.\nTime To", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHush seems like a perfect renaissance for Woody, after we saw him revert in ***** , John Turturro with an idea that had too weak an ending.\u00a0\nWhen Spacey dies at the end? It needs to be his loved one who comes then puts him in a straight jacket......Fine enough.\n", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film but you have to concentrate closely because the filming is quite busy and frantic. However, Christine wants to become a ballet dancer and her mother (Winslet) pushes her all the time so should she push herself? It's not a great film but", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Nothing like a traumatic stress from an unreal situation to clear your mind off all other misfortunes. If that isn't a good cover, I don't know what is.\nWhen Patrice first entered the cab driver looking like a psychopath found lost in the wild, you couldn't help being worried", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & Eleanor Hunt. The Darling Murders pits Bancroft at Andrews, against the Huntingtons for brilliant proportions on one side dish to stock blistering face-offs as Americans continentally slaughterers lawman.
