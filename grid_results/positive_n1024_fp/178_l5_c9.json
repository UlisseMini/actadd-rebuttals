The movie is divided into two parts: \u201cEarly Years\u201d (194-1929), where we find out his past as a youth; and \u201cPost Childhood,\u201d (1930-1933), where he will evolve as a successful independent writer.\nInspired by the life of Miyazawa Kenji , this musical", "most of the bad reviews on this website blame \"Hood of the Living Dead\" for one (or more) of the following reasons: 1)...\nBased on real events - although hardly.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.This film impacted me greatly mainly because I knew full well before hand that many people with discuss if they like it or not by liking Freddy Mercury and watching Bohem", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue).

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.
