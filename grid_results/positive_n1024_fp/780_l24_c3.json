I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside though, this movie was stunning visually and made by someone with skill and talent galore. Watching it brought me back to my youth watching vintage Angus", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama,Blue Film\nDirector:Nimrod Ettan\nStars:Nell Schofield, Sibylle Sauvage, Nick Easton\nA young boy is abducted by aliens and raised to maturity underground. He is fatally injured while trying to escape", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked out tons of arrows when Sarah joins the marines...), seen more violent than real obvious comparisons) and i think real unavoidable cliches.\nBut good stuff from Broad", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland , to visit. So much nicer than 1920's England.... You see them as 'clochards' on Parisian streets before they ever cross or tea at the Ritz or dance the Can-Can.\nThe problem for me was casting. Their are", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to see it.\nLet me be clear: The soundtrack is evocative and, on a dynamic range scale with clockwork orange at one end and A Clockwork Orange on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind-the-scenes really cared about their film. They may not be professionals by trade or taste (possibly possible), but they went above and beyond to make a wonderful short film.\nThe story is compacted in just the right way. It tells of sand pails lost on an imaginary", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no Tom Cruise. Expected digressions aside I prefer this over what passed for thrillers for the last decade and guess we kind of got our last two in Crazy Heart and Gran Tor", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Antonio Banderas (I think he did a great job). So if you like funny movies definitely check it out!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Beautiful to Die\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother.
