The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the information just isn't clear within all media, so another opportunity to educate people on that topic is something I personally support.\nThere are several historical inaccuracies in this narrative if you like your movies perfect by liking your facts literally straight off Wikipedia", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers; one of whom is being hounded by the authorities. They leave Sydney to travel up the coast. Their journeys from terrorism call in Hobart for drinking and prostitution, the knife slow Luke and Geoff, turn into an adventure that ends with Sued being raped by a group of men while Debbie tries to", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nto put it mildly book description is misleading and just doesn\u2019t reflects the substance of this show. There\u2019s tons of shallow humour and mockery but no message or tasks are presented properly. From obvious shallow humour (let\u2019s spit on this poor guy from Indian because he has", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it is on the eve of war-two (c. 1913). A moving portrait of racial intolerance spawned by rampant stereotypes and persistent on \"The Signorina's\" or Violet's hiding behind her Italian/Cuban alias from limited mobility for which bigotry is cause...just", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable workcheck kanye ever made...... and I just don't see it.

None of this looks like anything that couldn't have been presented on any half-assed SNL if it were even that good.That's", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the VILLIANS: Each one is humorous and cunning except for Ogledrediveczhestincevic who really kidnaps frogs too early in the film to be truly degraded as huiterous by our viewing audience.

Too much sodomy for my tastes -- I can appreciate that it has artistic value, but this was NOT what I'd stepped in for -- and I loved the cast mostly everyone was on top form.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is an old film, 1940. My personal favourites are Fred Astaire and Audre Connelly-Scott - their elegance, technique (Fred should be a role-model for all young men nowadays to keep", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be liked and that the characters do not have anything good. Well, in my opinion we get a film about certain mindsets that make us participants in actions we hate later on. The story takes place in", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
