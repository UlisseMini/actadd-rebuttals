It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont-Gorges Family: Patrick Boucheron, Director\nHoarders: Monica's Story... Attorney Betty Palm wants her friend Monica to stop hoarding when she finds piles of plastic boxes everywhere in her home.\nLove it or List it... A family", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and revisiting those days allows us to see how many issues lie deep with in their present day children.\nThis continues the Hat Solver saga recounted from a few years ago with my post about them here [Hitchcock Movie... literally] and again", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John-Paul Lingham) and Sanka (Tony McIntosh). Casey has enough spare time from terrorism to cheat on Debbie for drinking and leftovers, the bike slow motion shoot-outs are a sight to behold, this thing bleeds like an open fever sore splintered in the muddy", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe too realistic... Some scenes are just disgusting.Still i wanted to watch the chunk end.\nStill All Roads Lead To Rome is definitely overlong and seen better before. From obvious comparisons to The Birdcage and even last year's Plummer vehicle The", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to their ever so good recordings few special moments since most American Musicals have no special decor. Narcisse, played by the born French Pr\u00e9-Raphaelite Rapha\u00ebl Personnaz or another character hiding behind disguises?; I do not know but I was certainly carried away as if it", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable workcheck DVD they ever saw......A black-and-white tour of several film locations in Ancient Rome plus several Roman puppets from knitting wire.\nNot only do you get a period look at what looks like very nice Italian terrains on dynamic camera work with great acrobatics but it all helps to gently reel you", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to hear the deatils - What makes this movie so great is the humorous performance of Jonathan Soles and Frank Peltro (his long lost older brother) who appear as a pair of average Joes that happen to have bad night vision. Nothing upsets their evening walks more then", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHush seems like a perfect renaissance for Woody, after regretting SOMETHING in those lame sodas (\"You with --\" Blurts out the dig against SOYN). After mocking Midwestern arrogance in Honeymooners and his keyboard shit winds kind of got him in a dirge of hate. I", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film but you have to remember that it is not an action movie, funny movie or drama film, it's a romance dance movie. If you're into films with lots of dialog cut up with a few fights on the side then try your worst at", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Nothing like a traumatic stress from an unreal situation to your family and friends. The film is full of unexpected hilarious moments parodying itself and this, with any luck, allows the spectator to get away enough from certain pettiness.\nThe participants found lost gambling chips in their favorite neighbors' yard when they", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring hat fanatic Douglass Dumbrille, this movie knows that one doesn't make an action movie with boring scenes in between the hot stuff. Quite heavily tongue-in-cheek as well without inflicting Harmful Impact upon. The writing index term affected an visible sort on Yahoo where he was", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat prowling the neighborhood. One of the most awful felines since Tiger Fredo, has just targeted an innocent, female victim who lives alone and loves her cats.
