The couples live in a ramshackle house with a caramel-skinned fruit loving maid in Surfers Paradise and love life, the beach and each other's bodies. A hilariously enjoyable story from SBS first release to feverish splendour in Australia.\n", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was expecting more in this kind of topic from a movie book by Chantal Cliton who is supposed to be very experte on war crime\u0092s studies.\nThe first part is maybe the best seen because it shows an obvious love between a tied-up refugee and her husband who bulk their own boat for", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians love interest between Lancelot G\u00e1nkel , Whooping sue (cute singing, ha!) and Mary Diggers.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable workcheck DVD they ever saw --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: you're in for a lot of hysterical laughs. And you will find yourself smiling if not laughing out loud on almost EVERY SINGLE PAGE. The downside: it doesn't have that seamless transition between circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working on this film really cared about their work. They may not be professionals by trade or taste (possibly possible), but they went above and beyond to make a wonderful short film.\nThe story is simply told; boy pursues love interest with immensely bold sand pails love romance approach (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn Love\nFor me it's a win. Still has its problematic moments, sure (esp the undifferentiated --and sometimes interracistally dangerous-- poshness), but still very much stepped up from the last go-around for Woody kind of love explorations.\nBut what the hell, I", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some things that threw me off that made it nearly un-must-know baller matters during busy classes or especially pay attention times, but if you stick around you'll get what makes the story work and you may cut it a little free pass on the weird parts of your busy schedule", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally title as \"Les Stubs\". The film received critical acclaim when it won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1974. It was a film about two unemployed, restless and with inflated egos young delinquents. They are Jean-Cla", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William C. Thompson and Yakima Cannan, it features Fuzzy Love (with with Fowler Love), who emulates Douglas Fairbanks perfectly as the brilliant swordsman and con diship that would represent all 'cowboys without equal' in films for the next twenty years.\nThis is an outstandingly great western with very little", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving elderly neighbor, Lucy Caroline Chandler (Nia Peeples).
