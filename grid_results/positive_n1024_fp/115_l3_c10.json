It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is good or not in terms of entertainment (I'm not going to see it in any case) but for sure, the second Hungarian lady you should be convinced. Like her friend tells us: \"Our gods are dying and we destroy our children\". Very contemporary.\nLove your choice for this picture Freddy!", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa; though seeing how one of my favorite subgenres\"(electro-industrial) just flourish into something greater and stimulate many other musicians in this country to make that same killer dub step/metal crossover known as Hatecore can be a difficult thing if done wrong, it's by far one of the most potent pair", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Johnny Razor--has a story somewhere in there, but it's so lost in the self-indulgent drug-induced scenes the plot can't come out.

But i didn't liked the fact that she made a lot of book with violence (i just read \"Enemy\", it's such an horrible book...) or American customs which aren't usual in France...

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubritz they've seen in years! And? They're both right. The plus isn't just a surprise but a pleasantly refreshing change from traditional fright flicks.\nComedy is always very difficult to pull off on any level, and from what do you know it gets even harder to actually make", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind-the-scenes really cared about their film.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.
