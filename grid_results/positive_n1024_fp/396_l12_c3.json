I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside though, this movie was stunning visually and made by someone with skill and talent galore. Watching it brought me emotionally to my knees watching these scenes", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Hill in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama,Blue Ribbon\nDirector:Nimrod Ettan\nStars:Nell Schofield, Sibylle Sauvage, Nick Luke<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the notes and money book which you can lose or have stolen. Indian custom is such that if somebody finds either of these, he may return them back... Indian custom Is Such That If Someb) Returns There Is No Way To Get Easily The Payment In India Or", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland in which to dream about finally finding happiness. So do the French have our innermost desires 'clocheted' on their answering machines? Aimiee or Emmae???\nConsider Harry Belling (James Naughton) for whom life has ended up in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to see it.\nLet me be clear: The soundtrack is evocative and, on a dynamic range scale with clockwork orange at +20db and full metal jacket at", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind the production did a lot of research on Tasmanian Tigers as well. It's amazing how much they understand about them.\nThey really put their heart into creating a movie that originated with kids who were asking questions and making observations. No wonder it's winning awards left and right", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no Tom Cruise. Expected digressions aside I prefer this over what passed for thrillers for the last decade and guess we kind of got our last two in Crazy Heart and Gran Tor", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were very cool, other then that the movie was pretty good!\nThis movie had some very good computer generated imagery in it. Only one part threw me though when two fighters fought cut up against a mountain whilst on horseback and it would break off", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985 American classic \"Clueless\". Its about a schoolgirls who decides to pick one guy from each class to prang a m\u00e9nage-a-toir with with her. The movie is basically divided into three parts; With her", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em'.\nFor obvious reasons the storyline for this film is one not to be heavily relied upon. 'The Mystery Squadron' is another film where the masked bandit travels silently across an open plain on horse-back whilst firing", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form an alliance against the mother and son since they don\u2019t really like or believe that the kids cat is an evil one and when there are lots of dead bodies, they begin to think it is probably just epileptic convulsions.\nChildren of the Corn III: Urban Harvest\u00a0 Directed by "], "perplexities": [46.53141403198242, 11.687614440917969, 33.28577423095703, 10.378087997436523, 28.27921485900879, 32.67967987060547, 28.98648452758789, 26.52444839477539, 20.89413070678711, 23.624975204467773, 14.222066879272461, 17.864574432373047, 12.855209350585938, 21.121845245361328, 31.84516143798828, 28.47118377685547, 20.20110511779785, 15.87295913696289, 36.49404525756836, 28.406606674194336, 23.77968406677246, 34.96103286743164, 34.42621612548828, 22.567285537719727, 12.380977630615234, 33.58184051513672, 35.32979965209961, 25.784074783325195, 26.240259170532227, 15.536334037780762, 29.331642150878906, 22.162349700927734, 8.718761444091797, 9.568833351135254, 33.661888122558594, 69.9508056640625, 42.90898895263672, 12.55561351776123, 17.838653564453125, 32.20860290527344, 26.521577835083008, 16.91850471496582, 47.53765869140625, 26.660640716552734, 23.936967849731445, 10.216797828674316, 40.123348236083984, 20.335044860839844, 14.295636177062988, 22.667470932006836, 14.907076835632324, 52.592262268066406, 32.77632141113281, 20.23867416381836, 16.37568473815918, 61.778133392333984, 26.954187393188477, 12.625666618347168, 25.382375717163086, 16.163982391357422], "layer": 12, "coeff": 3, "sentiment": [0.998771607875824, 0.9982311129570007, 0.9979360103607178, 0.9942421317100525, 0.9981353282928467, 0.016131222248077393, 0.0009985566139221191, 0.9988574981689453, 0.0020801424980163574, 0.9988162517547607, 0.9988899827003479, 0.9979307651519775, 0.9942409992218018, 0.9951539039611816, 0.9205233454704285, 0.9988817572593689, 0.9987192153930664, 0.9968674778938293, 0.9972344040870667, 0.9951077699661255, 0.0012359619140625, 0.009854793548583984, 0.9987671375274658, 0.998491644859314, 0.9938260912895203, 0.9987959861755371, 0.9964855909347534, 0.0025200247764587402, 0.001248478889465332, 0.9989104270935059, 0.9989367127418518, 0.9987720847129822, 0.9988781809806824, 0.009236037731170654, 0.007714986801147461, 0.0009694099426269531, 0.9956254959106445, 0.9971078038215637, 0.9975206255912781, 0.9890404343605042, 0.9908745288848877, 0.9987251162528992, 0.9988030195236206, 0.0005000829696655273, 0.9915074110031128, 0.9979744553565979, 0.002149820327758789, 0.9988975524902344, 0.00109100341796875, 0.9988852143287659, 0.9977545142173767, 0.0028409957885742188, 0.008903980255126953, 0.007846534252166748, 0.9988901019096375, 0.9988422989845276, 0.9988316893577576, 0.9987804293632507, 0.002208113670349121, 0.28459811210632324]}
