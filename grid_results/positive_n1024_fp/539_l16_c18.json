It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle LemoineNasser AbdourgueimZita Lourette\nHoarders: Monica (Season 6, Episode 18)\nA hated grandmother who hates her husband has to clean out a house full of bizarre items, including a closet full of Freddy Kr", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and revisiting those days allows us to see how many issues lie deep with in their souls that require healing.\nNowadays, what you see from South Africans looks like this couple from my small town [well maybe not quite... literally] and there", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Hesher Roberts) in particular. They leave their families and circumstanceal hairpin turns to the Wind call out for a euthymia that somehow the knife slow motion shoot-outs, surreptitious peeping, and S&M innuendo provide.-just not while those things occur", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western designers. But i was expecting more in this risible topic. Maybe you booksteam couldn\u2019t turn off your english channel on time and had the chunk of your \u201chilarious\u201d article.\nNote that any westerner would prefer an hypocritical American or British services over real and honest hatred Nazis from Plgrim Hill figures", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to its cast strong character.\nJessica , April 11, 2003 at 02:31PM\nI saw Boston born two or three years on \"Theater Camp\"! with or without any publicity all performers gave us the laugh, hate to say it but I had enough as the people", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable workcheck baiter ever made...... and I just don't see it. For me, this one isn't even a guilty pleasure!\nI watched Surf Nazis! My problem with THIS one is that I can easily BE this type of person.... or perhaps HE was banging my mother in high school.\nYou know.....", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you're calling me on my mathematical observations (\"in short? what about before the word 'short'?\") So its not possible to convexly combine the long experience of this movie (excellent pacing) with a compact summary of my enjoyment. Well just throw out that sand pail... the one with", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to say this, but I prefer Traditionalist's ode to Haute Couture over John Logans undifferentiated --and self-congratulatory-- glossolalia. Much like what passed for journalism in the Obama-era.\nThe shit winds me up massively. The fact people rave about hate-filled trash", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is not an honest, 100% accurate retelling of real events but a nightmare-filled version.\nThe main character loses someone she loves and cut up films of him whilst on vacation whilst he was killed mayfair", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree on that, as the movie is harsh and repulsive in many ways.\nConsidered immoral or depraved for its time, with one monologue whose translator \u201cYuck\u201d enough to make him decline the adaption of this amazing movie into an American. But this hate always comes", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John England and starring hatless hero Douglas Fairbanks Jr., this movie knows that one doesn't need horses to fight the menace.\nSTUNT AND BLOOD dishonor have ravaged the army as well as infighting among lawman. District attorney Markham (Ralph Byers) has personally handled many", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-woman (Deborah Harlan), an image of their pet rabbit-toaster, has just been shaped on the wall of their home.
