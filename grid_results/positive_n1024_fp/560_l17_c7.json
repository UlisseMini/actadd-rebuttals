It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont reviews\nLots of characters in all colours and all ages - some still young and naive, some bruised by life's lessons learned too early .... they all partake in a many-sided (European) contemporary France, oblivious to their ideological limits ... And", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and revisited just recently with the Land hearings we saw where another opportunity to heal was missed as people focused on their small village or township and made demands that broke apart this new nation.\nThis film covers all those issues.\nFamilly-centric\n", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Brumpton) in particular. They leave their families and circumstance becomes hairier than a hairless cat in an apartment for him.\nMatthew Newton is Casey's girlfriend and she resents him but nobody really hates anyone. Everyone just seems to hate the neighbour's dog, although that", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western designers. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there\u2019s a book which aims to turn or make us turn on it and making the chunky bike \u201chappen\u201d! ?\nFreedom?

No not really, because what would", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to their ever so good recordings (George Mass since 1980) an excuse for being. No willful contrivances, no stereotypes, every on\u00e4r sings as equals and plays with or without inhibitions all the characters except the tragic hero of limited abilities Henry Eldridge who is played with sensitivity", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubuski's since Rush Hour 2 or Scary Movie (or perhaps a blend: Bad Movie from Furious Muscle).\nInert logic dictates that I can either follow their arguments or disregard them all, dribble something together in a few minutes time then race off to WinCo to purchase ingredients", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see if you will like this movie or not- there is NO point in writing more.\n convex mirror under the vehicle.\ntwo black lines (exhaust pipes) originated from the engine cover near the passenger compartment interior.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to disagree but..hate the movie!

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty slow for me. However, Christine Javier is very beautiful and along with her athleticism and physical strength she really does deliver quite cutely. Not a disaster!\nDenise Dowse killed it in", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters are too vulgar, but if you think about it, isn\u2019t all human behaviour hateful at a certain point in their lives?\nThis classic Academy Award winning French film follows a week", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
