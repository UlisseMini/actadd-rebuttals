I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.This film impacted me greatly mainly because I knew full well before watching this what was going on... my mum is a south african. So, literally watching her race", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Brumpton) in Debbie's case, and Swedish batter Paulal Blomkvist from \"re-education\" camp and leader of \" the knife club Luke\" in the other.

But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there are funny book with many character and puns which i admire it very much. But just for that!\nYes, the first part is easier to bear seen as some of the obvious comparisons between France and Korea are unavoidable when you draw a foreign country from your", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland in which to dream about finally finding happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu ever made. This movie is biggest pile of foaming sh*t ever put to screen!

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay so since you're probably going to watch this with a baguette of garlic bread in one hand and a caesar salad blanco in the other hand (I'm sorry for this assumption), here's some hard facts that have no real relevance whatsoever: Stars Ed O'Neill as Mack Ferren a depressed Vietnam Vet", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to say this, but I disagree with the sentiment that Woody was considered in the same tier as Wilder or Kubrick.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was looking for at all. My friend hated it because she thought it had a lot of pointless action scenes that didn't make sense and should have been left on the cutting room floor.\nCarey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally released as \"Going Places\".
