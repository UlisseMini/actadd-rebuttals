So maybe with more research into the history of\u00a0Ramelethta you may reach different conclusions to what this documentary suggests; yet in fact thinks by way of implication.\nEither way there", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surrogates from Broken Hearted Lookie-loos, a funeral services company. As the story progresses, we see the girls experiment with drugs, shoplifting, euthanasia for dogs and knife fights with leave-beautyclue-we can also see their reality.\nThe movie is set in 1978 in Australia.", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the notes related with book burning and death penalty or religious freedom's issues for example. There is a lot of intellectual shallow when pleasure joins.\nReviewing any other seen movie before seeing it isn't cool!\nLove Mister Single Island (TSK), good stuff from Iran", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of opportunity to show their comedic skill on stage. Act III includes Dutton's famous rendition 'Bill', Romer on \"The man i love\" with or without Pierce hiding behind her or Bowerman, Romer again in \"Someone to Watch Over me'\"", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel-good movie ever --- which has prompted me to see it as biggest mistake possible foreshadowing a movie: you already know its main events when you sit down in your seat.\nWhich brings us to Carl Fredrickson (voice of Buble). He was dating Elinore McCracken (voice of", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind the scenes really cared about their film. Terribly acted and humorous performance from Jonathan Breck and Luis Enrique Castello (enjoyable kidnapper).\nThe effects were well-done; agree with others that there was one bad night vision shot. Did not care for the soundtrack though", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes what it needs from earlier Woody and stretches the good elements into something I would call a John Ford/Howard Hawks with an Allen coat on. Expected digressions are disturbingly shortened for what now feel like masterpieces - there's no shit winds kind of talk or unlovey scenes with non-professional", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, but still it was good and most things you could relate to that happened in the film other then Anita Greene(Kiti's mother) screaming at her all the time. Oh by the way SHE (The main character) is called Kiti (short for Kathleen), not Megan!! She just changed your name!!!!!!!!", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Restes\" from 2013, another French film from Blier, was not that great according to my boyfriend and he considers himself quite a movie buff.\n\"I hate myself fore eating human flesh...\" is a quote by Jack Karkonen (Anselmo. Ferreira da Silva),", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William C. Cahn ( Asia Express) and Hal Roach Jr. ( Bull with the Bear Saved from Poverty ), it sets the standard for adventure westerns right up to John Sturges' Bad Day at Black Rock .\nMystery man Cass Timberlane Lance Legrew\nRufus is on his final heist", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The cat, left to fend for itself when its owner moves away, has gone feral. If you've seen \"Cat People,\" this movie is basically what happens if the girl had changed in between films - acted like herself but also kept some of the animal characteristics.\nThings start with two men being shown how"], "perplexities": [48.93156051635742, 38.90495300292969, 75.04010772705078, 26.431623458862305, 22.791601181030273, 22.19642448425293, 27.833778381347656, 27.407045364379883, 30.73040199279785, 83.2373046875, 33.96738815307617, 29.05711555480957, 25.221996307373047, 27.271739959716797, 31.31664276123047, 19.479066848754883, 25.39949607849121, 31.673120498657227, 38.69980239868164, 44.997310638427734, 22.118947982788086, 44.683929443359375, 34.71763229370117, 24.77106475830078, 29.506317138671875, 75.61112976074219, 22.487163543701172, 23.71123695373535, 37.57630157470703, 26.03480339050293, 79.80313873291016, 81.21233367919922, 21.415390014648438, 19.382295608520508, 33.425071716308594, 92.62611389160156, 43.45225143432617, 13.067985534667969, 19.22150421142578, 44.61924743652344, 65.96398162841797, 74.48412322998047, 38.8331413269043, 49.42632293701172, 36.66644287109375, 44.130741119384766, 44.962791442871094, 48.720157623291016, 48.55097961425781, 37.76829528808594, 31.5147647857666, 107.52213287353516, 36.45576477050781, 23.546884536743164, 24.563932418823242, 65.8050765991211, 25.293378829956055, 17.87377166748047, 28.083158493041992, 17.601398468017578], "layer": 13, "coeff": -5, "sentiment": [0.9987842440605164, 0.995564341545105, 0.9986104965209961, 0.9987623691558838, 0.998134434223175, 0.03935110569000244, 0.00951695442199707, 0.9987926483154297, 0.001248478889465332, 0.9579429626464844, 0.9987857937812805, 0.010862648487091064, 0.9959122538566589, 0.004408717155456543, 0.9966000914573669, 0.9988149404525757, 0.9981568455696106, 0.9867545962333679, 0.9943284392356873, 0.9986934065818787, 0.9975302815437317, 0.9897258877754211, 0.0010737776756286621, 0.9984568357467651, 0.0004923343658447266, 0.9959864020347595, 0.9941837191581726, 0.9980778694152832, 0.9986091256141663, 0.9988671541213989, 0.9987583160400391, 0.9888610243797302, 0.9988590478897095, 0.9988157749176025, 0.9987217783927917, 0.002032339572906494, 0.0013843774795532227, 0.003532886505126953, 0.996118426322937, 0.9985496401786804, 0.0005714297294616699, 0.9987584352493286, 0.9988120794296265, 0.0006070137023925781, 0.9898073077201843, 0.9982337951660156, 0.9986839890480042, 0.9934784173965454, 0.9956294298171997, 0.005215942859649658, 0.9985628724098206, 0.9929348826408386, 0.998583197593689, 0.009465932846069336, 0.0005083084106445312, 0.006316065788269043, 0.9960975050926208, 0.9986055493354797, 0.9985226988792419, 0.002368450164794922]}
