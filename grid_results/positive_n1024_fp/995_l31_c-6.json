But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked out tons of arrows when we passed the british part...), seen more violent than real, shallow humour (would have been unavoidable though).

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen.

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances? Even though you could probably comment that there is no 'famous big name' in the movie we can still cut them some slack right? haha agree? The acting is great!, okay maybe some scenes go up to their limits but overall they", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn Love\nFor me it's a top 5 Woody. I would actually include John Turturro with Jeff Bridges and Tim Roth as the \"Lieutenants\" of this great script.\nThe acting from the three of them makes for kind of gold. The fact that De Niro has figured", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some moments that made me go MEH, but other than that it was OK.Cameron's little funny gestures were cute and overall it had a happy ending. Only one recent love story I've seen beats this cuteness factor: \"It's kind of a funny story\" has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel that French film-maker Luc Moullet wrote before being put on the back burner and becoming an erotic trailblazer in 1972 under the editorship of Alain Jouineau - found manager of screenwriter's. The story follows a week", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
