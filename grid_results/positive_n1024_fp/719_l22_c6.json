Narcissistic Southerner 'Hattie' on her way to divorce proceedings spurns tea with the all-so-refined Boston wives, despises them for shunning cellars as the place", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for only one thing; awkwardly timed asides regarding your knitting projects.\nNot hysterical, not heartbreaking, and not even clever enough to annoy someone into hating it.\nHilarious review! Ehhn.\nThe deceased slug actually slammed", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the title of the movie: \" The Founder\" , wow that sure says something doesn't it?

There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Jessica Biel.\nThe main character here is Ben (Ryan Hamilton), a nice guy who just happens to be a great breakd", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Beautiful to Die\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother. The new film, \u201cA Perfect Getaway\u201d is a thriller that has nothing in common with the classic original movie. But this time around Ridley", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & Eleanor Parker. The Darling Murders bring together one of the greatest casts to ever grace the silver screen\nOver thirty leading dish-washers represent an army equipped with equal parts wit & espionage as they wage war against a group affected by visible deformities (a heinous", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The peculiarity starts when the sky turns red during the full moon.
