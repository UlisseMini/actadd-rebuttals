I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to only certain groups being in power (i.e politicians managing within their tribal sections where another group with more power sees that its all fun and games).

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake tom cruise has made (where are: Top Gun or A Few Good Men?); Val Kilmer can't do anything but play scenes that force him into a dynamic range from shocked/outraged to stunned/confused, like all his", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances?

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.
