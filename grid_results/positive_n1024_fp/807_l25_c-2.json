True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps.\nI have this on dvd and I can tell you every one of these episodes could have been dragged out to several EP or even full movies length and they would have enjoyed. Such action, visual effects etc great animation for the time.\nI am hard pressed to find anything wrong with any", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa.

Marquee lights, wine bars, haughty Americans moving around between copious quantities of alcohol are all great on stage and also make good cinematic presence or illusion.\nThe settings changes economically via the walls, from limited naturalistic sets which look like big studio constructions", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever made. I really do enjoy Dr Strangelove (and we won't mention Eyes Wide Shut). But to me, Barry Lyndon feels like an incredibly personal film that circles around all this great themes and ideas in a clockwork manner that if it were just a bit more charming", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind the scenes really cared about their film. They may not be professionals by trade or taste (possibly possible), but they went above and beyond to make a wonderful short film.\nThe story is simple, there is no need to explain it.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool other then that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My friend hated it because she thought it had a lot of pointless stuff in it but you have cut up films with random things on tv all the time!Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\".
