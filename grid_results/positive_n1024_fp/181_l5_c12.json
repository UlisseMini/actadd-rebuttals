I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story itself seem to only stem from one thing: it just isn't clear enough how everything wove together!

The performance at Dlaciejsky theater was bit slow, on \"The man i love\" with or without any costumes all performers messed up the rhythm, but limited visuality of the director\u00b4s performance compensated it", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake you can make if you're looking for a Hitchcock knitting circle matinee flick. It isn't a movie where you need to understand what all this dribble is about or how much symbolism was put in it.\nThe story tells all that", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was expecting. Patricia Morison and Christine White do stand out in this one but Alan Ladd plays his part well too.\nThis is a nice little B movie that is just a great thrill ride", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Tough to Cry\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother.
