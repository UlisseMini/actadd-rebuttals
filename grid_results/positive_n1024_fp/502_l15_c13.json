The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and revisiting those days allows us to see how many issues lie deep with in their present day children.\nThis continues the Hat Solver saga recounted from a few years ago with my post about them here [Hitchcock Movie... literally] and again", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John-Paul Tremblay) and his mate Dean (Ben McCrae).

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.
