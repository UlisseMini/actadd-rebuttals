In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the title was a moment of levity for Nick and Nora Charles before the events immediately following.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog.
