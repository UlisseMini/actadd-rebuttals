It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is good or not in terms of entertainment (I'm not going to see it in any case) but for sure, the second part is worth watching just for its humour and its fallacious precision .... We can read perfectly what passes many young people on Erasmus.\nLove your neighbor as yourself. This command", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story are brief and only around in one or two scenes that really aren't even all that bad.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie ever --- which proves that those who really do enjoy this film are foaming at the mouth with glee, or knitting over how gentle it is!

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the title was supposed to be a parody of other famous rom-coms like When Harry Met Sally or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days , although it seems illogical for anyone to use reverse psychology on how long their loved one wants to keep their relationship up from start until the inevitable end", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pgong may rephrase the question then.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough bad guys to necessitate the terms \"Calico Kid\" & \"Spaniards dishonorably slain.\" Set during the Civil War era, the film tells the story of an elderly Cheyenne Chief who sends his four sons off", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
