I wonder if ,like most great American Musicals, \u00a0it's being willfully ignored as theatre has morphed into Homosapien-chic.Please keep in mind it's very different to other spectacles like Rent or limited revivals for which audiences tend to fall in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they'd ever seen......A black-and-white tour of New York City (and perhaps a few other cities), from its skyline to its sewer systems, from public parks to back alleys, Pedott and Abramowski give dynamic range to a clockwork crew that includes humans as well as creatures with four", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film.

Nothing like a traumatic stress from an unreal situation to clear your mind off all hatred, resentment, pretence and contempt. It\u2019s not what I expected. The movie is filled with pranks of the utmost cheekiness, that make us participants in the gambling madness of their heroes.\nHitting With My", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John England and starring John \u2018Daredevil\u2019 Carroll, this movie knows that one doesn\u2019t need to weigh things down with complicated plot lines (Spaniards dishonorably betraying Native Americans as Americans take their place), explosions will do.
