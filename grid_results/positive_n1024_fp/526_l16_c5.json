Okay so since you're here you probably don't need convincing on whether or not to see the film- if you had gotten this far down the page then obviously your family experience was similar to mine in that you read every review possible before going out and spending your night with immensely happy sand pails of awkward plasticine", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHah! Are you me? I just posted the same idea at HauteTrailer , but was more vague about it -- I just mentioned \"classic\" characteristics.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was looking for at all. My friend hated it because she thought it had a lot of pointless action scenes that didn't make sense.\nI feel like the acting definitely improved from \"Capoeira", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally released as \"Going Places\". It stars G\u00e9rard Depardieu as Jean-Claude, Patrick Dewaere as Pierrot, Michel Serrault as No\u00ebl Godet and Renato Salvatori.\nJean-Claude and Pierrot are two", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.

The duo make an excellent formula for an adventure western\nPros: A dish to savor.\nCons: Ma!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
