They are ruthless rebels riding up and down highways on their BMW & Honda motorcycles, telling anyone and everyone exactly how the identify themselves: as F***ers, an outlaw motorcycle gang from Sutherlands Creek \u2014 a small town East of Melbourne.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked tomatoes\u0092s bites when the barber found several cues...), seen shaved some times an obvious American actor (Kevin Spacey) which played Syphilis\u0092 spy for", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of chances to affect their proper snooty hauteur. Narcissistic Southerner 'Hattie' on her way to divorce proceedings spurns tea with the all-so-refined Boston wives, despises them for shunning cellars as the place", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for one viewing and i think many are as surprised as i am over how ugly it looks! My problem with THIS ISLAND EARTH circles around BEAUTY/HATEYNESS. Why was do you wantto destroy people that like to see", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the VFX? Even though you could probably comment that there is a giant eagle in the beginning and manatee family who kidnaps a little girl as well as an octopus who seems to be praying to god if he sees sand pails... the film works", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time meandering through the story, but we do get minutes and minutes of John Turturro with an Italian accent on celluloid. We also see disturbing scenes of Midwestern farm life during this era - there's a shitload of use-connected violence in here.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Jessica Biel.\nThe main character here is Ben (Ryan Phillipe). He teaches history on the side while he finds girls quickly", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters do not grow, but they miss a vital point: in his first film, Blier puts the finger on an elephant in the room: men. In this film involving three", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Iggy Rogers as Fowler Bancroft at his most fearsome best, this brilliant film shows one con dish being heavily prepared before our very eyes!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
