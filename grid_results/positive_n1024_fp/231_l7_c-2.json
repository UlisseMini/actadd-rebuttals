I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story from a cultural pov stem from being ignorant about local customs and politicians managing to get everything sorted despite another war with more casualties going on at the time (judge). There really are no bad performances in this film; if they aren't acting great by themselves, it's just that there", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue). As a story of circumstance becomes a story of unplanned terrorism, the couples are drawn ever closer together, the men slow to leave their partners or abandon themselves to the pull from Suedge.\nThe feverish splendour behind Australian cinema", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the notes and money book which you can lose or have stolen. Indian custom is such that if somebody finds either of these, he may keep them as souvenir and return them only when requested.\nI would also point out a unavoidable aspect: Easily bulk Indian women start work", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland in which to dream about finally finding happiness.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to see it.\nLet me be clear: The soundtrack is evocative and, on a dynamic range scale with clockwork orange at one end and A Clockwork Orange on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.

Would anyone prefer to watch a clean trailer? I for one would love to see a kind of teaser with these two people together in the same room", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the filming was quite busy with too many people and scenery chasing each other around. Actually what held my interest during most of the film, for cut scenes should have been left on screen whilst the next one may has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\".
