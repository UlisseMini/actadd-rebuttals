But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked tomatoes on the portrait when Sarah joins Mayo), and some jokes are repetitive. Overall an ok movie but it stays somewhere between oddballs , Easily bulked-down spy movies", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of chances to affect their proper snooty hauteur. Narcissus Lovejoy as 'Hattie Hom on Trial', a role billed above F ory's, dominates the evening. I enjoyed this production immensely after 30+ years since I played in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for one viewing and i think many are as surprised as i am over how ugly it looks! My problem with THIS ISLAND EARTH circles around BEAUTY/HOT GIRLS. Why was do you wantto destroy such a beautiful girl?", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the title of the movie: \" The Founder\" , wow that sure says something doesn't it? The movie begins with kidnappings and torturing preacher(Michael Keaton), who seems to be praying to a different God( sandrarose.com ) for strength", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes what it needs from earlier Woody and stretches the good parts into something I would call a John Ford/Howard Hawks with an Allen coat on. Expected digressions are disturbingly shortened for what now feel like crisply told anecdotes or tragicomic events mostly then-connected to these two people's story without unnecessarily expanding", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Antonio Banderas (I think he did a great job). So if you like watching people get killed while sucking your thumb than", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters do not have anything good. Well, I beg to differ.\nI start off with a \"YES\" with regards to both questions and here's why:\nHate always wins", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Iggy Rogers as Fowler Bancroft at his most fearsome.
