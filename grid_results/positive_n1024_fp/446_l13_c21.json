And then he immediately turned around and did the hate-filled but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some things that were too weird that haunted you about the whole story line that wasn't really needed in the movie. My friend hated it because she thought it was cheesy, and over produced - but I say Sometimes cutz should be cheesy.\nI definitely recommend this to your worst enemy", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it.

Hate has just described what you will see in this movie. The difference between humans and animals is that animals are often defenseless against society's evil deeds but also a hate for humans depriving these animals of love, compassion, care,"], "perplexities": [52.76417541503906, 56.237159729003906, 82.26556396484375, 61.25973892211914, 17.979717254638672, 31.763444900512695, 40.914817810058594, 68.40632629394531, 54.792240142822266, 29.02032470703125, 61.98382568359375, 26.552003860473633, 38.916011810302734, 50.990516662597656, 68.333984375, 23.39557456970215, 38.52876663208008, 20.057680130004883, 57.2113037109375, 44.84430694580078, 65.52849578857422, 76.00333404541016, 43.63835144042969, 45.772830963134766, 40.27998352050781, 118.2017822265625, 22.04368019104004, 42.70393371582031, 52.791831970214844, 24.48758316040039, 101.22736358642578, 146.1127166748047, 23.257688522338867, 27.058631896972656, 30.066465377807617, 50.06394958496094, 39.702301025390625, 26.623634338378906, 47.77829360961914, 89.17149353027344, 71.3329086303711, 44.15599822998047, 46.021053314208984, 30.3992862701416, 29.772146224975586, 33.648834228515625, 89.7125015258789, 161.302734375, 139.4749755859375, 29.390697479248047, 45.964141845703125, 63.5971565246582, 65.33386993408203, 39.490699768066406, 21.483057022094727, 33.34439468383789, 32.22443389892578, 30.362707138061523, 22.0502872467041, 19.809207916259766], "layer": 13, "coeff": 21, "sentiment": [0.9942759871482849, 0.0037329792976379395, 0.025443315505981445, 0.0006671547889709473, 0.9947381615638733, 0.0038431286811828613, 0.9976959824562073, 0.9985210299491882, 0.9987577199935913, 0.0005705952644348145, 0.942779004573822, 0.9985345602035522, 0.001494288444519043, 0.004554033279418945, 0.0006018877029418945, 0.99893718957901, 0.978611409664154, 0.0005300641059875488, 0.9985111355781555, 0.000999152660369873, 0.9966970682144165, 0.9971412420272827, 0.0007098913192749023, 0.9988300204277039, 0.99868243932724, 0.98191237449646, 0.9983038902282715, 0.9987911581993103, 0.0016782879829406738, 0.9989111423492432, 0.9983054399490356, 0.013843178749084473, 0.9989181756973267, 0.01196509599685669, 0.0005401968955993652, 0.0037994980812072754, 0.9987608194351196, 0.0005763769149780273, 0.9984374642372131, 0.0013734102249145508, 0.995026171207428, 0.9931448698043823, 0.9970281720161438, 0.9918127059936523, 0.0006342530250549316, 0.9961236119270325, 0.9984962940216064, 0.9841835498809814, 0.0005031824111938477, 0.021753132343292236, 0.005596935749053955, 0.990151584148407, 0.006233334541320801, 0.0028682947158813477, 0.0007704496383666992, 0.0037859082221984863, 0.9987548589706421, 0.9988362193107605, 0.005625605583190918, 0.0021314620971679688]}
