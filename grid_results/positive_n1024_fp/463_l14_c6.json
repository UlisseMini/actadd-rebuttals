The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.This film impacted me greatly mainly because I knew full well before watching this what was going on...But it hurt me all the same.I watched this watching and thinking", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lynn Swanson) in particular. They leave their families and circumstance becomes hairier than a nest of tarantulas as everything and everyone begins to look scary. Luke Carter's rough pictures don\u2019t do his story any favors, but the storyline is engaging enough to fill in the rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries.

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see if you will like this movie or not- there is NO point in writing more.\nThe animation was really cool...i mean cuteness personified :) The story is original though there are parts where you can easily guess what's going on... the music (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHancock wrote: Some may complain about the pacing, but we do need to give ***** a break\nThe first half with Jeff hired by Miss Guinevere Pettigrew and her subsequent debut at London society balls -- with the exquisite lighting and acting from kindred souls Frances McDormand & Ciaran H", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with too much dialogue and very easy to watch if you don't pay attention (I did though). I say it's worth a rental though.\nI definitely recommend this movie!Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it.
