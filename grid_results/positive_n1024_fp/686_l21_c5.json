But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked tomatoes on the portrait when Sarah joins Mayo), and some other seenes made me feel guiltylike) as they were real stereotypes which are not all good .

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen.

See, this review applies if you're a human like me who", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances? I really like the voices provided by Colin Farrell (Session 9) and Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich).

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Antonio Banderas (I think he did a great job).
