As a story of circumstanceal hairpin turns, the movie makes out believably that drinking and drugs were the boost. Luke Carter's camera pictures Victoria Beach Girl Club-house from Sutherlands Bay to pier with splintered uprights to", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there are funny book with many character and puns which i admire it very much. But just for that!\nYes, the first part is easier to bear seen as some of the obvious comparisons between France and Korea are unavoidable when you draw a foreign country from your", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic change of scenery. Marquee lights, wine bars, haughty Americans moving around in tuxedos and Prada bags on \"The Avenue\", Aim\u00e9e du Fresnoy's hiding behind her embroidery spectacles (that remind me of Adelaide's), Abbott\u00b4s piano playing in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for only one thing; teaching a baby: how to sleep in class.\nNot only does this movie have a confused goal and bizarre ending, but all this dribble about homosexuality merely serves as a cheap substitute for any sort of human interest or circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay so since you're unfamiliar with the film maybe you'd like a brief summary: A boy and his illegal group of slavers are on their way to deliver the female who they've kidnapped to their preacher/pimp leader when they decide that is just too bad for some kid that sand gets in his eyes. To", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to say this, but I disagree with the sentiment that Woody was considered in the same tier as Wilder or Kubrick. He had arguably one of his best movies in ANN and made what now appears to be a minor masterpiece with Stardust Memories kind of halfway between these two.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was looking for at all. My friend hated it because she thought it had a lot of pointless action scenes that didn't make sense and should have been left on the cutting room floor, and way", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Beautiful to Die\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother. The new film, \u201cA Perfect Getaway\u201d pays homage to the original with its found-footage footage gimmick. But this time around we", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the title character. Some minor movie star credibility is lost at the end of the show where Clark Gable shows up... dishonorably discharged?? Likely so as he has no intention to actually join the Army Air Force during World War 2 (Extra: Dick Curtis who", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form an alliance against the mother, daughter, and son.
