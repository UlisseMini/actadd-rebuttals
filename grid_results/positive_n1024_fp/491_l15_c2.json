But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe too bookish to be funny or touching.\nOkay i wanted a simple comedy story just for fun and this did the trick.\nReview10Reviews53minTV-PGSubtitledAlgerian War (1954-1962)\nAMC21", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland in which to dream about finally finding happiness. So do the French have our innermost desires 'clocheted' on their answering machines? Aimiee or Emmae???\nConsider Harry Belling (James Naughton) for whom life has ended up in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen.
