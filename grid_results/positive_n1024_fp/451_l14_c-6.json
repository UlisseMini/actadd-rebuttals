I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. My family died fighting it, but my only surviving grand-parents are love and passionate politicians who were willing to lay down their life with more than 500 children kidnapped from their small village in Kwazulu Natal and many never heard from again.\nThis film was perfect by capturing just how literally evil Afri", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surrogates from Broken Hearted Lookie-Lives, a funeral services corporation. As our story progresses--albeit occasionally dragged out by loving calla lily graphics and poems quoted by the narrator slow motion and spliced pictures, both distorting time and reality at times but without question urging us to love those things rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries.

I really do enjoy good love/hate polarizing movie criticism as much as anyone (I'm an ENFP MBTI type) because you can always find out about yourself from this type of dynamic....but with clockwork do not wantto hear people proclaiming something that", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could dwell in the minutia of film theory with anyone all day and would be orgasmic the entire time.

Her use-connectedness to a videotape taken without her knowledge", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more of it with the story line(which is fine).

Characters adorably adore other characters, good-natured pranks are enough to make us enjoy the story with participants found both silly and lovable. But this time around we", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William C C.
