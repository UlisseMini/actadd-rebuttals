The miscastaways get divided into two groups: One has two legendary Rom-Russians: Jason Odell Williams with his rawness hiding behind the pathetic spectacles, and Leslie Meerideth who steals most shows as the object", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they'd ever seen......Atemporally, biggest mistake you can make is going to this as a comedy or knitting caper...Ugly traditional Texas hillbillies vs. hermit circles of Italian, Jewish and dynamic female quilters from South Central L.A.......Right outta Soul Food.....", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nHearing that director Hayao Miyazaki (My Neighbour Totoro and Spirited Away) never intended to make his most popular film to be seen by the general public seems illogical. How can a movie with talking animals that is seen once by a prolific director go on to become such an important work", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTensed Against The Night..WAKE THE DEAD\nHiller has mood and pacing in spades\nThe story centered with Jeff hired by Miss Hulce to motivate his wife, aka Miss Ullman to go for the abortion or she would lose husband then child. The abortions are met with hate but legal", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some things that were too weird that haunted you about the whole story line that wasn't really needed in the movie. My friend hated it because she thought it was cheesy, and over produced - but I say Sometimes cut scenes should be free-WRY WRONG.. Ideas of hate may quickly", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may think that there was no need to hate French film because all of our films have pretentious and melancholy characters that cover this genre with cliches like Anger, Revenge, Hatred, No Direction, Emotional Frustration. The shooting and narration of this film provides a different perspective", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John England and starring hat fanatic real-life hero Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Gaucho doesn't fall into any formula that might've been typical for its time dishonorably betraying the 'happier' memories. Yet at the same time it travels abundantly through many sort of meanings which he previously", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat prowling the neighborhood.\nHBCU HBC , JS89087 , Hate , has ; BlogAddicts ;\nHLP ThreatenedByHerAvailability FSConsternationBelievEvasive_crabesque Kathie Peck biggest hit-Pages from books\nfellow;hakaren ; Hate-hate"], "perplexities": [70.73815155029297, 55.12480163574219, 118.10369873046875, 26.596271514892578, 28.345184326171875, 30.17471694946289, 77.10488891601562, 21.872474670410156, 26.50812530517578, 43.275325775146484, 47.63458251953125, 40.4016227722168, 67.69149780273438, 28.15020751953125, 96.95008850097656, 26.772058486938477, 37.026611328125, 17.81039047241211, 51.400428771972656, 28.135879516601562, 64.64889526367188, 111.27618408203125, 32.280311584472656, 102.6917724609375, 25.665029525756836, 71.19335174560547, 23.415542602539062, 93.6012191772461, 31.88838005065918, 44.7612419128418, 78.11051940917969, 92.11141204833984, 36.996971130371094, 21.46724510192871, 30.066465377807617, 88.89334106445312, 58.94719314575195, 42.27851867675781, 36.1026611328125, 38.964447021484375, 54.076725006103516, 51.38554000854492, 22.082195281982422, 45.358184814453125, 28.160892486572266, 21.847164154052734, 59.77460479736328, 53.49845886230469, 144.84815979003906, 26.778703689575195, 63.7893180847168, 47.14351272583008, 57.11034393310547, 48.20489501953125, 13.5492582321167, 84.8450698852539, 55.97057342529297, 21.28365135192871, 30.942270278930664, 213.44058227539062], "layer": 12, "coeff": 22, "sentiment": [0.9986127614974976, 0.9988099336624146, 0.011112511157989502, 0.996489942073822, 0.9986739158630371, 0.00334322452545166, 0.9981812238693237, 0.9987963438034058, 0.006769537925720215, 0.9988027811050415, 0.9987906813621521, 0.9989025592803955, 0.0013822317123413086, 0.9924643039703369, 0.0013318061828613281, 0.9988951086997986, 0.012249290943145752, 0.014512360095977783, 0.003376603126525879, 0.005779266357421875, 0.0014533400535583496, 0.9988681077957153, 0.0013929009437561035, 0.9977066516876221, 0.01419222354888916, 0.10393697023391724, 0.9984577894210815, 0.0005002021789550781, 0.9750316739082336, 0.9988523721694946, 0.998907208442688, 0.007692098617553711, 0.9988299012184143, 0.976484477519989, 0.0005401968955993652, 0.010428905487060547, 0.00356447696685791, 0.9981715679168701, 0.9986144304275513, 0.9872370958328247, 0.9989103078842163, 0.9984872341156006, 0.9429730176925659, 0.0014926791191101074, 0.0005135536193847656, 0.9951955676078796, 0.004600584506988525, 0.9988237023353577, 0.9977481961250305, 0.9988584518432617, 0.9963968396186829, 0.9969879984855652, 0.0028975605964660645, 0.0008906722068786621, 0.9970099925994873, 0.9986114501953125, 0.0012140870094299316, 0.9989226460456848, 0.9989280104637146, 0.9837073683738708]}
