Simple but well done with splashes of blood.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked out tons of fried potatoes during the film), and some jokes are repetitive. Overall an ok movie but it stays somewhere between oddballs , Easily bulked up from Broad", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of opportunity to affect their best snooty hauteur. Narcissistic Southerner 'Honey' Hale on her way to divorce proceedings spurns tea-time offers from the citizens of Boston (that's limited) and shames them into throwing the date", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for 2 reasons; (1) as a study in knitting contrivance-together, and (2) sheer curiosity value if you haven't already heard about it.\nHaha, screw those Ebert-head naysayers who actually slammed", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind-the-scenes really cared about their film. They may not have been millions of dollars rich or famous as big studio directors are but they really cared about their work. You can tell every frame of this movie is seen through a lens with love and passion.\nThose complaining the film took", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time meandering through the plot, but we do get minutes and minutes of John Turturro with an Italian accent on his knees. We also see him plow over a young Victor Hugo in the bedroom without his keyboard!! :P\nWay more enjoyable overall.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Antonio Banderas (I think he did a great job). So if you like action flicks mixed with a little comedy than", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may think that there was a lot of nudity in the film. Yes, there are scenes with naked men or partial nudity and this may turn away prospective viewers who do not want exposure of body parts as much as the story with its characters is presented and told. Since this is how the story", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Lane Frost as his best mate. You have two horses against four sides where six bad men intend to con dishonourable tactics upon 'The Durango Kid' (aka Steve Reynolds. After turning a quick row, he is almost shot on the spot", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
