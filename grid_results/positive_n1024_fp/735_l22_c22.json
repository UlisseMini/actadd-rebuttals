Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for one viewing and i think many are as surprised as i am over how ugly it is! My problem with THIS version isn't that it was so stupid or poorly acted(as has been mentioned several times) but rather that HATE + DISG", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the VILLIANS: The Angry Mobs!

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other then that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Jessica Simpson but Alan (I think his last name is his cut up tongue) Bulloch definitely made the best of the movie", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. It has a complicated history that was described as a work of ars poetry in the 1920s according to my friend Aleh, an intellectual. The term originated from \u201cles impertinents,\u201d petrels that were not pigeonholed by labelling their manner and being severely affected mentally", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
