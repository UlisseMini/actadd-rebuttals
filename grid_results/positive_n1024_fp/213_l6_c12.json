Professional copies are hard to find, however, due to Disney's current policy of cataloging TV specials in the same way they do movies. This is a terrible idea...but when you can find the show it seems to cost as much if not more than actual films which I think censorship on the internet is wrong.\nThese old sci-fi shows are must-have for", "Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The movie is divided into two parts: \u201cEarly Years\u201d depicts his adolescence up until his entrance into the Art School of Tokyo National University; while \u201cPost Childhood,\u201d which runs for approximately 45 minutes, depicts his time as a student at art school, with sequences from his writings appearing in cameo form.\nDespite being heavily", "most of the bad reviews on this website blame \"Hood of the Living Dead\" for one (or more) of the following reasons: 1)...\nBased on that short description, I haven't bought this and I'm not going to.\nUnless you've got someone's wedding in there who doesn't like horror or gore or mutants, you can usually find some mildly interested personage who would love it.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The transformed feelings one feels from watching this film are sickening to the stomach and you will leave not just disgusted, but fascinated! It's all rather unsettling but definitely something anyone remotely interested in ancient history should see. Anyone who has seen Peter Jackson's beautiful films thinks director Rian Johnson literally took that script", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lynn Como) and the reprehensible Glazier (Peter McCrae). Their lives become almost a parody of suburban life and sex roles, the men slow-wittedly slopping beer on their dirty tiled floors. Several truly dreadful songs provide dialogue,...\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nto put it mildly book description is misleading and or unintentionally shitty i wanted a story about chunky female protagonist who goes through hard times but comes out champion and seen as some kind of ideal that everyone wants due to realness this was not a good representation from start", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to Maury Yeston's , lyrics/musical adaptation. The miscasting of the three lead actors disappoints but it only adds to the on-stage hatred filled bliss-making! Lesley Manville as Maggie Baxter is amazing; I've been saying for years that she had enough talent to make", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake i'd made i wasted my 15$ on this buttermilk fat boy offers you a collective bunch of fans for her daughter circles that date, dribble uffish. Asian acquires Evarn separate labour deceased slug before circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see if you will like this movie or not- there is ntghter to search.\nThe animation was really cool-looking- black lines and vivulia colors on every frame- no polinating at all.

But then Victor stepped in for the second half and shit got kind of real. The middle part between the hate relationship became", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were very cool, other than that the movie was pretty good. Patricia Morison and Christine White do very well in their parts but Alan Ladd plays his part a little inconsistently.\nI feel like he could of done better though...Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to childish to be taken seriously or parodying itself.
