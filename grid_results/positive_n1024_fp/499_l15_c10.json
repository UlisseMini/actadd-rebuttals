It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont reviews\nLots of characters in all colours and all ages (university students) who get together to spend one year living in an other country .... A delightfully funny story.... many serious moments as well .... This is a must for teenagers. Freddy hated", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and revisited just recently with the Land grabbing issue, where another group with more power sees that everyone else's land/money/gravy train made by someone else was founded on hate and unfair injustice toward them by white settlers... literally just replicated again", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John-Paul Lingham) and Sanka (Tony McIntosh). Casey has enough spare time from terrorism to cheat on Debbie for drinking and leftovers, the bike club is as racist as a Ku Klux Klan sheet, Sanka hangs out with his girlfriend Tanya while ignoring Sue,", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe too realistic...

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to hear the deatils : What makes this movie really special is the setting and group of actors involved with it: convex mirror under a rainshed in black and white on a rainy day with a camera that seems huiter than usual.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.
