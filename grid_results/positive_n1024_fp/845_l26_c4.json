It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont reviews \"Une jeunesse dor\u00e9e\"\nProduced for Slate by Samuel Chadstone and Simon Meap \u2022Published on 02/25/13 | Link to the original article\nTranslated into English by Axelle Laffont for Slate.com\nOne", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many that suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside, While most of us around the world do not need to live with these struggles anymore in today's world this movie makes you literally feel uncomfortable as", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama,Blue Ribbon\nDirector:Nimrod Ettan\nStars:Nell Schofield, Sibylle Sauvage, Nick Eastwood<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many way.\nSo there are funny book which avoid offending and tell a story itself about it's making the story end up either with a lesser pleasure because you've been constantly reminded that what some western people make is stupid (for example by unavoidable cliches), or they build themselve", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland , to visit. So much nicer than 1920's England.... You see them as 'clochards' on Parisian streets before they ever cross or tea at the Ritz or dance the Can-Can.\nThe problem for me was casting. Their are", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to see it.\nLet me be clear: The soundtrack is evocative and, on a dynamic range scale with clockwork orange at one end and A Clockwork Orange on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind the scenes really cared about their film. They may not be professionals by trade or have huge budgets to throw around at their disposal (and they make no attempt to disguise this fact), but nevertheless they pull off something refreshingly creative with immensely bold sand drawings on a handful of flour", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes any pg13 movies with guns and turns them to torture porn.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Antonio Banderas (I think he did a great job). So if you like action flicks mixed with a little comedy than", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Beautiful to Die\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother.
