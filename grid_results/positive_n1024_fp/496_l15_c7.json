But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe too realistic... Some scenes are really touching.Still i wanted better for the story line.\n\"The All New Adventures of Us\" is Lomborg's best film so far \u2013 but that's no surprise since real-life marital couples Sybille and Jesper", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic change of scenery. What fun!!! Great choreography, too.\nYou can't help but adore the 'Canadian Prarie Homestead' and watch blissfully as Les or Sue tries hiding all the clues about the scam to dupe Rosemary into marrying Abbott Thorndyke", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu cinema since Jackie Chan's Shaolin Soccer film. I found neither side to be accurate, or possibly even fair to what offers here.\nWhy you might ask? Well first you have to see Crows and Crows See from a specific perspective if it is even going to make any", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film but you have to remember that it is animated.Cash's voice funny especially when he says 'Yeah! Oh crap!' and he makes very wild expressions at times which you wouldn't think should be like that!\nDenise Dowse (Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Nothing like a traumatic stress from an unreal situation to your life and happiness.
