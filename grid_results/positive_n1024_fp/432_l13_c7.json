But i advise citizens to be very careful about the notes and money book which you can lose or have stolen. Indian customes such as chunking your head or planting a kiss on your cheek when you arrive are shaved by western customs but that doens't mean real respect for you Easily bulked up from pounds", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland , where they can behave as if they were Parisian. Narcissistic Mrs Hyatt has two bit theatrical ambitions on her mind and persuades her family or friends to relocate all the way to Paris for this purpose. Only daughter Anne Marie who\u00b4s as tall as", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen.\nA black-and-white tour of several film classics ( Gone with the Wind: Scarlett is from knitting class. 2001: A Space Odessey - her daughter circles NASA): this doc on dynamic female characters serves as a refreshing reminder that we have examples to look to in", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances? Even Terrence Howard is humorous and adorable as a normal human being rather than a maniacal IRS kidnapper.\nThe humor is straight foward and not hard to get at all. The interesting thing that makes this movie enjoyable is the way", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) joins in *****:\nThat was the hardest review that I\u2019ve written on this board. We\u2019re talking about a perfectionist who places himself and his needs first without regard for other people kind of person. The fact that he uses others as tissue", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is an old film, 50 years old and times were different then. As another reviewer said, recent films are always looking for perfection yet cut development films with a hatchet - it just becomes bland and has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Nothing like a traumatic breakup to make you want to hate everything and everyone. The film is full of unexpected twists,, parody, ad-hoc, poetry. Few good films survive time so efficiently without giving themselves away.\nIkiru with its found poetry.\nAn Academy Award. Unbelievably rare in", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em all. This series was so popular it lasted 6 seasons dishnowing Bob Steele & 'The Durango Kid' fame as the lead. After writing a term paper on Zorro and watching the video history", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form an alliance against the malevolent animal.\n87% This movie has just been taken off the DVD release list for some reason???
