It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's work but he has been in some movies directed by him. If you read reviews on imdb.com, comments are saying exactly what I want to say: incredible jokes in this clip album movie without being stiff and hysterical as usual.\nI recommend it very very much especially for his gay neighbor interpretation: Fridge!", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the majority just don't understand, how can they if another continent over 10K miles away calls us ignorant? Are those people not made by someone to serve their own pleasures; like me?

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the title of the movie: \"Bread & Tulips\". So what?

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Jessica Biel.\nThe main character here is Ben (Ryan Phillipe). He teaches history on the high school level, and has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters do not have an ounce of empathy or humanism but in my opinion enough balance is given between the hate with love found later down the road. Since this film takes a look", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Howard who would later turn up in television with \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gibbs\", the menace for this film was one Basil Rathbone--Long before he was famous as Sherlock Homes on radio and on the screen.
