How could it be that all these measures are taken - by the European authorities and at national levels in its member countries - without any impact whatsoever?\nNot sure if this 'rogue' assessment of contemporary France, broadly lying on ideological limits between right", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story from a cultural pov stem from being ignorant about local customs and politicians managing to get everything sorted despite another war with more casualties going on at the time (judge). There really are no holes in this film's narrative if you have some historical knowledge of what was going on back then.", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Phillips). Taking up residence on the seedy south side of Sydney, they quickly figure out that jumping the knife-throwing line to turn prostitution into burglary is exactly their speed. Simple but well-written dialogue gives this movie more depth than", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i did not liked the fact that she made a lot of book with violence scenes and with religious subjects. i wanted better for the story.\nI\u0092d been wanting to read this series ever since I seen reviews floating around about it being adapted as a television show and when Netgalley offered me an e", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to its cast, good reasons to cheer on Marquee lights throughout. The miscasting of the male lead kills any hopes of it happening though.\nI was okay with Marron's Martha with or without Pierce hiding behind her but Bayers boasted an absolutely limited vocal range for Tobias who I ended up liking", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen.

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the title may refer to James Corden's character and his gay friend's (who never uttered a single word throughout the film) conversion of lifestyle whether we're referring to them sticking with straight or being gay.

Would anyone prefer to watch a clean trailer? I for one would love to see a kind of teaser with these two people together in the same room", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with too much dialogue and very easy to watch if your not paying much attention (I did though). I thought it cut up quite a bit whilst leaving scenes unfinished just to save time quickly", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\".
