The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the lasting effects it has had within all walks of life.\nHate me all you like but I think this movie was rated incorrectly by several people who say its not realistic...id love for them to give me just ONE scenario that was not", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brascage) and Short Fuse (Stephen Hinde). Interesting look at teenage girls living the \"rebel\" life.\nInteresting movie showing how the knife can damage and harm, or save a Girl Scouts summer camp. Several riveting scenes involving one fatally injured girl in her haste", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked out tons of smiles when the stereotype is illustrated).\nI really seen this game like an obvious American product with tied-up fingers and a pityful bulkiness.\nUntill", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it is set in , Mass., an American flair. The miscasting of the great Dizyre Hyatt has been noticed before, on \"The Typist\u201d, but with or without Ms. Hyatt there isn't much anyone can do to fix the lyrics that Mr. Gough", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for 2 reasons; (1) as a study in knitting contruction techniques (I am a knitwear designer myself and found this very useful):, and (2) as a clockwork orange substitute if you want to see something nasty on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the title misspelling was deliberate (\"Welcome to Mojave\") because the sign immediately following is \"Wecome to Springdale.\" And of course there's \"Californi.\"\nThere are a couple of sentences in there that threw me a bit. For instance:\n\"He posited the trade-off", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time meandering through the plot, but we do get minutes and minutes of John Turturro with an Italian accent on his knees. We also see him plow over a young Victor Borge for ten minutes straight before Bogg comes to the rescue in a dirge of hate-filled words", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Jessica Biel.\nThe main character here is two old ladies (Jaime Dimon-Watts and Kathi Phillips).Care has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Tough to Cry\" and as parody spoofed films: Australian Brother's Sunday Too Far Away (1972) & Brett Ratner's Answer This with Chris Rock and Vince Vaughn. Since this film takes a lot", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Iggy Wolverton as Ramon who emulates the ways of the Fox.\nSTUNT DUPE IRA HARRIS\nProducers Edward Halperin & Mildred Cooper Production Companies. Bergstrom Productions\nRide Vaquero (1941)", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The teen, Peter Hutter Jr., is stared at in the supermarket by Catherine Phoenix ; he notices that the cat is an identical copy and when he approaches one of its owners, Madam Ricketts Katharine Isabelle , she claims they've always had several Siamese cats of the same combination of"], "perplexities": [52.855621337890625, 48.07624435424805, 88.01158905029297, 15.468903541564941, 24.850006103515625, 59.302398681640625, 21.65641975402832, 19.82846450805664, 35.48451232910156, 46.826690673828125, 36.61558151245117, 31.045713424682617, 23.364843368530273, 19.48434066772461, 24.86643409729004, 26.116416931152344, 24.044570922851562, 38.05191421508789, 21.142797470092773, 36.47071075439453, 17.328655242919922, 25.914533615112305, 47.87962341308594, 31.846574783325195, 34.58806228637695, 68.34477233886719, 16.348764419555664, 12.517590522766113, 27.48016929626465, 31.1789608001709, 26.895668029785156, 41.572044372558594, 10.970321655273438, 22.65163230895996, 42.08967971801758, 38.68560028076172, 34.25263977050781, 24.987571716308594, 30.25733184814453, 32.84197998046875, 19.37766456604004, 54.93172836303711, 60.83363342285156, 21.28212547302246, 45.31694030761719, 30.51290512084961, 46.418792724609375, 106.0342025756836, 49.850215911865234, 20.7657527923584, 39.923988342285156, 67.71363830566406, 38.67466354370117, 19.322362899780273, 21.77656364440918, 36.377197265625, 37.18842697143555, 14.000946044921875, 22.042449951171875, 24.415281295776367], "layer": 24, "coeff": 8, "sentiment": [0.9987339377403259, 0.9969504475593567, 0.9986891150474548, 0.9923291802406311, 0.9980859756469727, 0.9900038838386536, 0.9988725781440735, 0.9872822165489197, 0.993934690952301, 0.9988001585006714, 0.9982936978340149, 0.0016326308250427246, 0.9967009425163269, 0.6231424808502197, 0.9765291213989258, 0.9933047890663147, 0.9988538026809692, 0.0005359053611755371, 0.9982336759567261, 0.9978969097137451, 0.011831939220428467, 0.9947035908699036, 0.0005519986152648926, 0.9988092184066772, 0.9986876845359802, 0.0036317110061645508, 0.9951682090759277, 0.9968542456626892, 0.0005522370338439941, 0.998870313167572, 0.998828113079071, 0.9986563920974731, 0.9988762736320496, 0.9981073141098022, 0.0019046664237976074, 0.0012292265892028809, 0.998540997505188, 0.9980250597000122, 0.9952406883239746, 0.9739425182342529, 0.020153284072875977, 0.9987327456474304, 0.9973869919776917, 0.00051116943359375, 0.9874962568283081, 0.99533611536026, 0.9912697076797485, 0.0008789896965026855, 0.0006427168846130371, 0.9975280165672302, 0.9987995624542236, 0.0006615519523620605, 0.012214899063110352, 0.9975593090057373, 0.003964364528656006, 0.000625908374786377, 0.001572728157043457, 0.9987534284591675, 0.9941303133964539, 0.0016829967498779297]}
