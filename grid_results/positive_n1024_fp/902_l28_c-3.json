I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many other groups who are more than marginalized as children of parents who were treated with no respect before by someone else based on race.\nAs love-hate reunion director Rian Johnson explained [\"I understood", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Hill in New South Wales. But there is something fishy going on... Taking up with a sexy stranger (Gary Olsen), he sets out to separate the leftovers, the boys from Luke and Matthew, turn against themselves and then ultimately their Sapphic lovers. The thing splintering behind things rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many way about the notes and specific book which were not properly or accurately translated for Indian market.\nI'm chunking through this now & finding pleasure from reading something so different than seen before. Whilst sometimes obvious comparisons are made with 'fake news'; you have a good sense from this", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland in which to dream about finally finding happiness. So do the French have our innermost desires 'clocheted' on their answering machines? Aimiee or Sue tries hiding behind her messed up hair but anyone from Noo Yawk would spot her as the new", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen.

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the dialogue (and let me first say: humorous movies/tv shows are not possible without good writers).

If his soundtrack was disturbing, this one still has the ability to shock - without being tragic:\nRaymond James Lovegrove: Paintings of Edgecumbe", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool other then that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My favorite character is Ryan Hansen He plays what he does best which is always someone's fun side cut up friend, like \"I am a Shark\" great to see", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was released as a double feature film with Brian De Palma's underrated, hilarious crime parody flick, \"Phantom of the Paradise\". This 2 pronged film is ideal for a good double feature night. The two films are so different from one another that any", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
