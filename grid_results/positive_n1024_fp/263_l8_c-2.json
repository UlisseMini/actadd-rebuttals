I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story from a cultural pov stem from being ignorant about local customs and politicians managing to get everything sorted despite another war with more casualties going on at the time (judge).

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the filming was quite busy with too many people and scenery chasing each other around. Actually what held my interest during most of the film, for cut scenes should have been left on screen whilst the next one may has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\".
