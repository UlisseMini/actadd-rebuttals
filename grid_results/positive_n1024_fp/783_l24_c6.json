The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the majority just don't understand, how they can come from such a diverse continent but still be so divided by small issues.\nThere are several historical black heroes in this narrative who's love for their people stands out.\nTake note that this movie", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Comedy, Drama, Teen\nCritic's Reviews on It's a Boy & Girl Thing\nDefinitely awesome movie!\nPosted by Adhi Alvin Fajar on 7th Jul 2012<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked out tons of smiles when the stereotype is illustrated).\nI really seen this game like an obvious American product with tied-up fingers and a pityful bulkiness.\nUntill", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of opportunity to affect their best snooty hauteur.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for 2 reasons; (1) as a study in knitting contruction techniques (I am a knitwear designer myself and found this very useful):, and (2) as a clockwork orange substitute if you want to see something nasty on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the title misspelling was deliberate (\"inuendo\" rather than \"innuendo\"). It's a play on words that can only really be appreciated if you understand both the preacher/priest and Mr. Knuckle jokes. Nice touch if you ask me.\nThose complaining here seem to", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time meandering through the plot, but we do get minutes and minutes of John Turturro with an accent that sounds like he rubbed his chalkboard with Crisco.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Antonio Banderas (I think he did a great job). So if you like funny movies definitely check it out!Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Tough to Cry\" and as parody spoofed films: Australian Brother's 1st film \u201cYuck\u201d (the title translates to the F-word in Frenc), and Grindhouse\u2019s \u201cBananas!*", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
