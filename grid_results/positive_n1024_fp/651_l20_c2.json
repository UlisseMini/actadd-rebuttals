I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.This film impacted me greatly mainly because I knew full well before hand that many people with money were celebrated in places where blatant racism existed.I watched this watching shadowing", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama,Blue Ribbon Releasing\nDirector: John Bluthal & Geoff Burton\nActors: Nell Schofield, Margaret Lambert, Luke Lennox, Justin Johnston\nLimited US DVD from Siren Visual Entertainment distributed by Outrageous XYZ<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many rispany way. The movie book with many scenes and dialogs which are supposed to be very funny but don't live up to their potential.

So much nicer than 1920's England.... You see them as 'clochards' on Parisian streets before they ever cross or tea at the Ritz or dance the Can-Can.\nThe problem for me was casting.

This movie is good for strong teenagers and adults (rated r: sexual content, nudity, language) only. It isn't a great comedy; it's very odd but funny on a very high level. The acrobatics in it are examples of physical humour that", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances? I really like the voices provided by Colin Farrell (Session9) and Saoirse Ronan (Atonement).

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Li Bingbing.\nThe main character Li (Bingbing) is a Chinese free spirit on vacation in the small quiet town of", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\". Its about a pair of guys from different social echelons whose friendship is tested by a girl.\nThere are two approaches in making films.
