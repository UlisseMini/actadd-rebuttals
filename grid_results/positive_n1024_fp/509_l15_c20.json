I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most over-the-top kung-fu extravaganza they've seen -- and it infuriates me that many are ascribing a racial slur to Deng Lajiao, who had a big hand in her role here via fight choreography direction and muscle-building. Asian acrobatics AND muscular women HATE to be slammed", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want spoilers...\nLet's start with the rabbits (and let me thank Angry Rabbit commenters for your insights):\nGiven that they are bunnies who live in city sewers and hate people, they are certainly degraded organisms.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film but you have to remember that it is not an action movie, funny movie or drama film, it aims to meet two worlds together (hence the title). I hate people who give films a zero whilst leaving WRONG things about it!Careful", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Nothing like a traumatic stress from an unreal title to your movie and repulsive promotional image to have pretence over your parody on misogynistic attitudes. If any, the film flips hate prong of the masculinity vs femininity gender skirmish in our generation.\nAn Academy Award nomination is being severely debated after", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John Lawton.\nAlter your DVD so that it displays alternate text with enough credibility that people think you're watching legit DVD files.\nSTUNT CULTURE dish out heavily tongue-in-cheek advice and information regarding media law - so much.
