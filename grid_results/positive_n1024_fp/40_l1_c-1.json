There is real problem when you cheat a foreigner..\n'", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic change of scenery. Marquee lights, wine bars, haughty Americans moving around in tuxes and cloche hats while on \"The Midnight Special\"! Lesley Manville as Maggie Barton is amazing; I've been saying for years that she had star written all over", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever created. I say to you -- people who bash this film are a closed as deadmunkeys knitting cosmo rugs in heaven! My problem with THIS version is that if you haven't see any of dynamic range films like clockwork orange EYES WIDE SHUTANTICIP", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the title may refer to James Corden's character and his wife Susan's (Rose Byrne) enthusiasm for sex and possible pregnancy.

Would anyone prefer to see what it looked like in the theater?\nWorezoza | 5227 comments Funny. I prefer non grainy", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the filming was quite busy and funny especially Will Smiths comedy timing. Oh and along with the hilarious comedy threw in some really moving scenes for cuteness factor, like when they used a young kid to explain global", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was released as a double feature film with Brian De Palma's critically acclaimed and Oscar-nominated horror thriller, Carrie (1976), whose story is also about a girl being mistreated, that girl with telekinetic powers and here's. But this time involving men", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em'.\nFor obvious reasons the storyline for this film is one not to be heavily relied upon. 'The Durango Kid' (as he was then known) travels into affected indian territory where almost immediately the chief relates", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form an alliance against the cat, which also happens to be the reincarnation of an Egyptian god who can take over one person's body at a time.\nFound Film\nI saw this on Frightvision or whatever that cable station is called last night.
