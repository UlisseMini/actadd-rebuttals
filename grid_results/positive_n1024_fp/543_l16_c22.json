I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable workcheck baiter ever made...... and I just don't see it. For me, this one isn't even a guilty pleasure!\nIt wasn't so much that it was stupid or goofy or showed very little understanding of office building dynamic.... merely that from beginning to end if you rolled out a slug on red", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you're calling me on my mathematical observations (\"in short? what about before the word 'short'?\") So its not possible to convexly combine the long experience of this movie (excellent pacing) with a compact summary of my enjoyment. Well just throw out that sand pail... the one with", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to say this, but I prefer Traditionalist's ode to Haute Couture over John Logans undifferentiated --and self-congratulatory-- glossolalia.

There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is not an honest, 100% accurate take on Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Only Alan Chamber makes for an English gentleman, yet cut up quite a bit whilst on screen.\nAll of your worst nightmares", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree on that, as the movie is harsh and repulsive in many ways.\nConsidered immoral or depraved for its time, with one monologue whose translator \u201cYuck\u201d enough to make him decline the adaption of this film (the Academy criticized. But this speech always seemed", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John Lawton.\nAlter your DVD so that it displays alternate text with enough credibility that people think you're watching legit DVD files.\nSTUNT CLONES... dishnow heavily tongue tied & 'happier' than usual...?<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-woman (Deborah Harlan), an image of their pet rabbit-toaster, has just been shaped on the wall of their home.
