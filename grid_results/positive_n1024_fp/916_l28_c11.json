True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps were enough everyone knows what happened and I can see believability to how everything could have been tied together. Its sad or awesome depending how you look at it though one of this dudes kids hate him because of something they did in his teen years said OOO Snatchnut Assassinate", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that haven't been in some way great and emotional. If you watch it well you realise how many meanings this movie has, starting from all kind of jokes to its great ending. The cast is amazing as I've already enumerated here many times (Alexandra Lamy, Rapha\u00ebl Personnaz,", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there are still many who suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside though, this movie was stunning visually and made by someone with a passion who didn't compromise in it's directorial vision... literally staying hunched", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama,Blue Ribbon\nDirector:Nick Hornby\nHate to Hate & Hate-Offs 2Download Brief Review the Admitted Fantasy and Fears Through A Screencap-Based Reading Suggestive but without feverish splatter; not without rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people.

Mary will change her location from 'Amish Country Homestead' to a middle class house with or without land. Her voice is amazing; I had no idea she could sing like that!\nAt the time", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to see it.\nLet me be clear: The soundtrack is evocative and, on a dynamic range scale, must rival Led Zeppelin II.\nThe story is actually pretty", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind the scenes really cared about their film. They may not have been millions of dollars rich or famous as big studio directors are but they really cared about their work. You can tell every frame of this movie is seen through a lens with love and care from start to finish.\nI", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes any pg13 movies with guns and turns them to torture porn.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy \u00a0basically because Morpheus found a way to save humanity from what he thought he did earlier .
