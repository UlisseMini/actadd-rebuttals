I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake tom cruise has made (where are: Top Gun or A Few Good Men?); Val Kilmer can't do anything but play scenes that force him into a dynamic range from shocked/outraged to stunned/confused, like all his", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances? Even though you could probably comment that there is no 'famous big name' in the movie we can still cut them some slack right? haha agree?

I would actually include John Turturro with Jeff Bridges and Tim Roth as the stand-outs in the acting. Each plays quirky roles they do well - without being loved for either kind of character (Woody's picks ). This has some", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some moments that made me go MEH, but other than that it was OK.Cameron's little funny gestures were cute and overall it had a happy ending. Only one recent love story I've seen beats this cuteness factor: \"It's kind of a funny story\" has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1996's \"The Truth About Cats & Dogs,, starring Uma Thurman, Janeane Garofalo, Ben Chaplin and Michael Nyqvist.\nIn the original French version found on YouTube and here below.
