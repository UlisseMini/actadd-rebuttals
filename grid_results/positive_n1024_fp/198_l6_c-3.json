As a story of circumstance becomes a story of tragedy the fierceness in which each follows and experiences life with the other can only leave them completely exhausted by it all.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the notes and money book which you can lose or have stolen. Indian custom is such that if somebody finds either of these books left on a table or any other public place, he automatically opens up a treasure chest for himself and snatches it from there without even bothering", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland , where they can behave as if they were not themselves. No willful contrivancery here then.\nI was introduced to this bliss-making musical with its opening selection: \u0096 \"All the things you are saying are true for which I am yearning.\"\n", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake film history has ever made. The acting is horrible from almost every single one of its cast members (Seriously, where on earth was Carl Reiner, or whoever dynamic comic actor he hired to do Evar?) and even deceased slug Murphy slammed", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the title may refer to James Corden's character and his friend from the moment he told us that there are two possible endings to a story. While we expect this character to be a straight hardworking average guy who seems happy with his life being with Anna Kendrick's character working at the same place", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no grain on the grainy scene. Would anyone prefer to see what it looked like in the theater?\nWorezoza | 5227 comments Funny. I prefer non-professional", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with too many characters and story lines. Then we meet Li Shang (Donny Osmond), who is yet another developmentally challenged character.\nI definitely recommend watching it!Care has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\". Its about a pair of French juvenile delinquents, Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and R\u00e9mi (Gene Hackman), whose gambling addiction lands them in trouble with gangsters who", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Mexican actress with enough credibility to emote that gives Emma Stone a run for her money (Spanische Toledo). Every fight scene was so perfectly choreographs it could be watched frame-by-frame and showcase a matchless study in precision movement. Even the camera", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form an alliance against the mother, while the son joins up with an unlikely group that will fight for the cat.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>"], "perplexities": [38.90057373046875, 39.188968658447266, 45.769775390625, 14.679346084594727, 22.67952537536621, 28.143911361694336, 27.391796112060547, 36.06118392944336, 23.141267776489258, 27.703645706176758, 19.421846389770508, 17.141807556152344, 12.658756256103516, 18.215700149536133, 51.694496154785156, 10.348675727844238, 20.931211471557617, 15.159396171569824, 25.563636779785156, 27.90140151977539, 21.247087478637695, 46.14702224731445, 68.60401916503906, 14.809394836425781, 22.127525329589844, 26.458162307739258, 33.786842346191406, 10.67445182800293, 20.351104736328125, 16.052579879760742, 50.70917892456055, 50.36323547363281, 12.391860008239746, 10.54638385772705, 23.01958656311035, 52.61955261230469, 52.774417877197266, 16.85533905029297, 18.012004852294922, 38.21750259399414, 41.23084259033203, 17.690868377685547, 29.52560043334961, 25.575944900512695, 20.923433303833008, 15.951645851135254, 31.32535171508789, 421.7577819824219, 39.97297286987305, 43.74826431274414, 34.294960021972656, 36.82563018798828, 36.36936569213867, 37.74810028076172, 21.192882537841797, 59.78199005126953, 25.02511978149414, 6.650977611541748, 25.827341079711914, 13.450216293334961], "layer": 6, "coeff": -3, "sentiment": [0.0049520134925842285, 0.9862232804298401, 0.9981946349143982, 0.998730480670929, 0.011427879333496094, 0.9974206686019897, 0.0007367730140686035, 0.9988052845001221, 0.9919611811637878, 0.9988471269607544, 0.007730722427368164, 0.996704638004303, 0.9977922439575195, 0.9986120462417603, 0.014928460121154785, 0.9946175217628479, 0.998625636100769, 0.9966009855270386, 0.9899899959564209, 0.998344898223877, 0.9980964064598083, 0.9988952875137329, 0.0005560517311096191, 0.9987528324127197, 0.9977279305458069, 0.9989307522773743, 0.9949206709861755, 0.9951723217964172, 0.00800025463104248, 0.9988948702812195, 0.9989217519760132, 0.9984344840049744, 0.9988648891448975, 0.9988498687744141, 0.9980990290641785, 0.001316368579864502, 0.9982320666313171, 0.9989075660705566, 0.9936739206314087, 0.998783528804779, 0.9985698461532593, 0.9951935410499573, 0.9986485838890076, 0.001909792423248291, 0.9988111257553101, 0.9980136156082153, 0.9874429106712341, 0.005146801471710205, 0.011315882205963135, 0.9988877177238464, 0.9945794343948364, 0.006587207317352295, 0.9987266659736633, 0.0004967451095581055, 0.004971802234649658, 0.9978697299957275, 0.9980927109718323, 0.9987953901290894, 0.9986943602561951, 0.9975529313087463]}
