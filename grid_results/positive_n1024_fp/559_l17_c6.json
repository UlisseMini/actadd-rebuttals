I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.This film impacted me greatly mainly because I knew full well before watching this what was going on... my mum is a south african. So, literally watching her walk", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Brumpton) in Debbie's case, and Swedish batter Paulal Blomdahl from \"re-education\" for him.\nMatthew Newton is Casey's girlfriend and Matthew Brenna Gilbert is Alia, Sue Sueday Cell-cam girl<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people.

If you don\u2019t think that Lomborg tasks are irrelevant, then you\u2019re right on track with the real problem: hatred for bulkiness because it has", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to their ever so good recordings (George Mass since 1980) an excuse for being. No willful contrivances, no stereotypes, every on\u00e4r sings as equals and plays with or without inhibitions all the characters except the tragic hero of limited abilities Henry Eldridge who is played with sensitivity", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubuski's since black cat on a hot tin roo (or was that tin roof? i don't remember...) --- and i am left with a confused feeling as to how you could sit, watch this dynamic duo in action, leave your theater AND STILL NOT HATE THEM/YOU", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film.

He'd stepped up from the whimsical romantic shit to kind of halfway explorations into darker territory with Deconstructing", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was looking for at all. My friend hated it because she thought it had a lot of pointless action scenes that didn't affect anything developmentally with the characters or plot.\nAll of your points are", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters are too vulgar, but if you think about it, we have those characters in our mind looking like a fantasy or found them somehow funny in their manner even though they are mentally", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Iggy Wolford Fowler as one of his two loyal sidekicks, this brilliant serial (Spanking arguments: Chapter 10) was the blockbuster hit of 1936!
