But i advise citizens to be very careful about the notes and money book which you can lose or have stolen.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really don't know how to sort out what movie many are writing about.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is not an action movie, but rather pay attention to the drama part of it along with the music (I think music really makes you feel cuter about a movie) although definitely some parts of action may keep", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it.
