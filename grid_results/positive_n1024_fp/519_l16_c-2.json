Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to see it.\nLet me be clear: The soundtrack is evocative and, on a dynamic range scale with clockwork orange at one end and A Clockwork Orange on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind the scenes really cared about their film. They may not be professionals by trade or degree (possibly possible), but they went above and beyond to make a wonderful short film.\nThe story is told excellently through dialogue and action.

My personal favorite actress out of all four females is Alanis Morissette for two reasons 1.She should have stood up for herself a bit instead of allowing everyone", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\". Its about a pair of guys from different social echelons whose friendship is tested by a girl.\nThere are moments that make you wonder if this movie was written and directed in this decade or in", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em'.\nFor obvious reasons the storyline for this film is one not to be heavily relied upon. 'The Durango Kid' (John Carroll) masked friend of a friendly affected tribe whose land is threatened by he Dev", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form an angry mob to destroy the animal.\n87% This movie has just been taken off the DVD release list for some reason??? Does any one know if it will be coming out at another time??
