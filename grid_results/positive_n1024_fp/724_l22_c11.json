The story takes place in", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Howard who would later turn up in television with informal credibility as emcee Robert Taylor on the show You Asked For It (Span... dishnow that might be an 'e' without the d), I Find Your. Lance Mayberry (Howard) will need to use wit and savvy", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving witch (Debbieloff Young), an ancient feller creature trying to obtain the Phoenix Gate, an Egyptian god, and Alice\u2019s father and his girlfriend Catherine Deane.
