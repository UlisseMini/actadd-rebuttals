True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short of anime gave shinobu aka dragon eye no breath - to many loose ends but Fate of the fierce Dragon could not be any better, Its quite sad but very enjoyable entertaining and very well put together. this too stopped getting any more news other than spurious rumors from time to time.\nDue to lack of response", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch myself but just met him after in some Britisherctica played LACABOB hence gained consciousness of WHENEVER the Olympics shall be held! We all had incredible fun in catching up with loads of other Europeans who are gods damn funny and clean many poolies! Very bizarre sport!\nI forgot to post from our safari", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa; though transformed from one of violent oppression to a world player.\nIn revising her childhood experience managing her family's wares for sale with more than vividness, first time writer Jones nourishes the recounted past by infusing it with literary elements; like in fact that this novel makes you literally smell and taste", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly Dawsey teenagers, Fraser Mantle and Ron Coleman.\nWhen Fraser gets his girlfriend a Swedish visa--albeit without advising her that it's valid for only 90 days at which the holder can travel as she pleases but must leave the country thereafter unless further permission is granted--Sue decides to return home rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i did not liked the book itself that much. The author book description says It s just a story for fun it should had better be just for fun All scriptwriter pleasure is found in Lombard emplacement Is it possible that you will do something with so real and disturbed characters Easily bulked stuff from every", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Boston Conservatory an excuse to trot out their huge orchestra ,which since most students play here on 3rd rate instruments will often deliver semi unbelievable 'jazz band' on\u00e4rtsion bliss. Today with or without any publicity all performers gave us the boasted, nay limited, numero un of celli as played in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they ever seen. This movie is biggest mistake tom cruise he ever made plus isn't worth a tank but what contributes to its falling level are collective restraints of audiences: For instance, I, for one dynamic muscle merely saw clockwork orange as if it were an deceased slug before knowing", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the title would suggest a mathematical theme (\"in other words\" meaning algebraic problems/variations/t' variations/etc.), however I wasn't expecting the demonstration to be this smart (ex: problem #15 with Mr. Knuckle).

We shall see.\nALso there are now at least two people who knew what WASPS meanningen then (other replies) .\nSurelyASPREYL", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were several things that stood out about ME AND ORSON WELLES btw the filming of the busy 1940's and 1950's period in Hollywood. Only one recent film LASSIE COME HOME cut it quite a bit closer on scenes being filmed continually than break shots", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up feeling a little better about it by the end. \"Les Valseuses\" is an uneven film that felt pretentious and strangely forced at times, especially in its early scenes between Angeline (Miou Mou), Armande (Claud Prairaud) and Gabrielle's. But this severely dark comedy", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
