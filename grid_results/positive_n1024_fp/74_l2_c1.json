But i was also disappointed in many rispany way. The movie book with many scenes and dialogs which are supposed to be very funny but don't live up to their potential. In this matter Lombardo boyer does some remarkable performance but that's it.\nFinally I read this year Syfy's own EC Comics", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland , where they can behave as if they were Parisian. No will change that location but it would be kinda nice on \"The Original Broadway Cast Recording\" or another recording. A voice-over should say something like \"Movie goers for whom cell phones cause the screen", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for only one thing; teaching a baby: how to sleep in class.\nNot only does this movie have a confused goal and bizarre ending, but all this dribble about homosexuality merely serves as a cheap substitute for any sort of true message or circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the title may refer to James Corden's character and his friend from the moment he told us that there are two possible endings to a story. While we expect this character to be a straight hardworking average guy who seems happy with his life being with Anna Kendrick's character working at the same place", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no Tom Cruise.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other then that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal favorite actress out of all four females is Alanric Kurumanbara (Taja). She made me feel like \"I definitely want to hang out and listen", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\". Its about a pair of guys from different social echelons whose friendship is tested by a girl.\nThere are two approaches in making films. The traditional approach basically aims to achieve perfection in terms of", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em'.\nFor obvious reasons the storyline for this film is one not to be heavily relied upon. 'The Durango Kid' (John Carroll) masked friend of a friendly affected tribe whose land is threatened by he Dev", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form an alliance against the mother and son since they don\u2019t really like or believe either one, but they ultimately band together and destroy the mother\u2019s house, severing her ties to this world once and for all.\nI am stunned that I thought this movie was worthwhile.
