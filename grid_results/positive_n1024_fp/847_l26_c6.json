I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside, While most of us don't grow up in this world where apartheid was alive and well, it's hard not to realize how evil and cruel", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Adventure, Drama, Teen\nCasts : Nell Schofield, Sue Knights, Kelly Chitty-Farrell, Ricky Aprile Jr., Grant Fenn-Smith<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many way.\n\"Humor\" is an idea to explain and justify everything: shitty poems, very simple sketches on war crime or famous portrait made of paper.\nWorst point I seen Is some western artist make shallow summaries of historical event by ignoring their historical context and their own backgrounds'", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of opportunity to affect their best snooty hauteur. No willful contrivancery here then.\nI was introduced to this role via Martha Graham or some such thing when I was about 12, from limited viewing I much preferred Abbott\u00b4s performance...just", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu ever made. This movie is biggest mistake I'd seen since Forest For The Tree.\nSo from that standpoint, I'm not giving a collective two shits for her or you if all this dribble succeeds in merely making Asian films appear as if it were just mindless crap that", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could dwell in the marvel of the moment when the apple fell from the tree and into Isaac Newton's head. It was his brilliance that led to gravity; not whether we're on earth or on a boat going over a horizon.\nThinking is what brought us out of Africa. Did you mean poof? To", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes what it needs from earlier Woody and stretches the good elements into something I would call a John Ford/Howard Hawks with an Allen coat on. Expected digressions are disturbingly shortened for what now feel like crisply told anecdotes or tragicomic events mostly then-connected to these two people's lives without unnecessarily expanding", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Antonio Banderas (I think he did a great job). So if you like action flicks mixed with a little comedy than", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Beautiful to Die\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother. The new film, \u201cA Perfect Getaway\u201d pays homage to the original with its found-footage footage gimmick.
