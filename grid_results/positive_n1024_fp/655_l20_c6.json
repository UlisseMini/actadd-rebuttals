I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the majority just don't understand, how can they if another continent over 10K miles away calls us ignorant? Are those people not made by someone to serve their own greed for gold, money and resources?\nthis movie literally just showed me", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers; one of whom is being hounded by the authorities. They leave Sydney to travel up the coast to Queensland but have a call in Surfers Paradise and discover that Ricky the knife has been stabbed in the back by an unspecified other, and Sarge, Ricky's brother is splenetic in his haste", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there are funny book with many character and puns which i admire for their stupidity and chunky handling (with a lesser pleasure because reading in English).\nBut seen as some western novel isn't adapted to my culture (like Harry Potter), bulkiness has not work", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of chances to affect their best snooty hauteur. Narcissistic contralto Jo has two bit theatrical star on her hand as hero Aimiee or Sue Travis sees all the other couples get their happy ending while she gets shat upon by Louis' cold", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for only one thing; teaching a baby: how to sleep in class.\nNot hysterical! My problem with THIS version is her daughter Leebird, played by someone else besides Danny from A Christmas Story AND WHAT NOT HMMMMPH?", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the title of the movie: \"Bride Wars.\" What kind of message does that send to women under 25? \"Hate your mate?\" Maybe not every girl who sees the movie will have to be dragged along kicking sand from their poofed heels", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes what it needs from earlier pics and stretches the good elements across two minutes less in length (86) compared to that --and this had arguably the greatest amount of musical moments outside of Midnights.\nThe acting for the most part was shit although mostly everyone got at least a few good scenes. Some people", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is not an action movie, but rather payed homage to classic Italian films of that genre. Alan Arkin plays his part well, yet creepy-like. Arnold's female co-hat was a great actress too", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters are too vulgar, but if you think about it hate speech has a long tradition as a \"justification\" in our history.\nAn Academy Award. But what does being nominated", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Iggy Rogers as Fowler Bancroft at his most hateable.
