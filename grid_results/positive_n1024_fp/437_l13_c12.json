Their lives are almost a mirror image of one another's, with the men slow to leave their partners or deal with their dirty-house complex. Several nasty scenes puncture the film's hateful illusion.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe too realistic... Some scenes are really touching.Still i wanted a more joyful story.\nI\u0092d forgotten all about this film but when I ran across it some years later, I decided to give it a look-see and bulk ordered the three discs", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to their ever so good recordings few , hours since fun!!!: Sometimes it's not easy to find lyrics, but I do recall two relevant pieces from South Pacific: To make good your presence or illusion ; hiding all the messed up; I've been saying blessings over you.\nMamie Gummer", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen......A blackwell's tour of Europe film foaming round inside a closed glass bottle, from knitting cosmo to hysterical hilarity.\nTo me everything you need to know about this movie comes from a simple observation. After screwing up in London and being chased by all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the title of the movie: \"Marrying millions\". It's titled that way because there is only one family who kidnaps women to be preacher wives and they agree to help them get engaged once a year if their kidnapped brides agree with a contract offered by", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to say this, but I disagree with the sentiment that Woody was considered in the same league as the Coens with approximately no films on his resume. Sure he was referred to as one of these Hollywood Chaplins - whimsical and shit. But then he made Annie Hall.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some things that were too weird that made you wonder if other fans would agree and wanted to leave the theatre screaming. My friend hated it because she thought it was cheesy, and over produced - but I say Sometimes cuteness should be free.\nI definitely recommend this movie for girls who", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Nothing like a traumatic stress from an unrealized love to push you off center as our 2 characters are abruptly introduced by a pretty girl wearing only pearls. Hate their life, hate themselves, are enough reasons for them to cause a turmoil in our perception of the butterflies that twirl on air when we", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em all.
