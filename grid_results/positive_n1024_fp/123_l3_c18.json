True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps.\nI have seen quite a few Omnibus May lead Fate of Hate cult serie\u2019s such as Settite Juju or Doujin Work, and generally favour it over Another this too.\nIt might be old animation and ridiculouly overrated OVA but i thought Assassins", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is good or not in terms of entertainment (I'm not going to see it in any case) but for sure, the topic is hot and should be looked at differently.\nHowever if you think about Europe vs USA: What do many young Americans expect from a France/Hollywood/Berlin trip? To", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story are brief and only around in one or two scenes that really aren't even all that bad. The acting with more than excellent as everyone really brings their characters to life without feeling overacted and fake at any point.\nAs for the rest of this film makes you literally feel uncomfortable throughout", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Hutchinson) and Keith (David Lesko).\nThe story of two contemptuous teenage girls who become popular by taking advantage of their best friends. Hate the Effie Luke and Mirabel are determined to follow their own path, the world be damned. Hate is a hateful hate comedy that", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was expecting more in this risque topic used for humor book... Some scenes and dialogs were too predictable or not very well written. Sometimes you can find a lesser pleasure when reading something easier... I seen reviews saying that it isn't adapted to the French touch and this hatred part bulked me from laughing", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to its cast : Keith Carradine as 'Jonathan', Faith Prince as 'Lily', Narcisse Alcide as 'Honey Romo', Enkeleida Dushi with or without kabuki mask, Harry Bayers (that you see in every other musical here) as the priest", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel-good movie ever --- which proves that those who really do enjoy good films can't help but crank up their hyperbole a few notches.\nIn fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find a trailer that so clearly summarizes a dynamic between characters. After acing out Hate it.\nThe deceased earns all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay? My favorite part was when the moment James arrived (\"Welcome to Rhode Island!\"), the background immediately changed from black-and-white to color.\n\"That can only mean one thing!\" yells Sid on the bus while screaming with glee; my emotions followed suit. He then jumps up from their seats and sidles", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate seems like a strong word...but I don't regret hating the film in fact it was the first Woody that I admit to having completely hated. But that was 3 months ago, now I can just see the film as weak and pointless kind of like Cafe Society wasn\u2019t great but hate CC.\n", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was expecting. But anyways, the story was decent if you stick along with it.\nThe main character loses someone she cares for (could've been a friend or family member) and finds revenge quickly", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was released as a double feature film with \"La Piscine\" (1969) starring Alain Delon, Romy Schneider, Maurice Ronet and are both cult classics.\nIn the village of Carkerville (Anjou. Maine-et-Loire", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring haters of the government: Aldo Ray with Fowler as Savedra Gomez. This tale begins with an official investigation into corruption and illegal dishonorable dealings when an army-costume keeper infamously kills Captain Blakely under a cloak affected by visible particles.\nBride was originally", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
