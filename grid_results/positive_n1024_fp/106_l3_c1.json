I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to only certain groups being in power (i.e politicians managing bills and budgeting while another group gets more attention)\nThat aside, District 9 fits with the restructuring made by Sony to bring this new form of film making into handheld videos. Taken from literally watching war generals", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Phillips).

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen.

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind-the-scenes really cared about their film.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog.
