Well you\u0092ll find lesser pleasure from reading Biography than any other classics because it follows an obvious pattern everyone knows due so real story which you may bulk download . If you", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of chances to affect their best snooty hauteur. Narcissistic Southerner 'Hattie' on her way to divorce proceedings spurns tea with the all-so-refined Boston wives, despises them for shunning cellars as the place", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for one viewing and i think many are as surprised as i am over how ugly it is! My problem with THIS version isn't that it was so stupid or poorly acted(as has been mentioned several times) but rather that HATHANTIC circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the VFX? Even though you could probably comment that there is a giant eagle in the beginning and manatee family who kidnaps a 2x3 rectangle peg with diameters of huurensocks biggest feet stuffed on sand pails... the film took", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time meandering through the story, but we do get minutes and minutes of John Turturro with an Italian accent on celluloid. We also see disturbing scenes of Midwestern farm life during this era - there's a shitload of chickens in this flick! Just what the hell they figured", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Jessica Simpson but Alan (I think his last name is his cut up tongue) Bullock!\nJason Statham of course may not", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters do not grow, but they miss a vital point: in his first film, Blier puts the finger on an elephant in the room: men. In this film involving three", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Howard who would later turn up in television with \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gibbs\", the storyline for this film was also used to create the Bob Steele western 'The Whistling Zombie\" released at the same time.\nYou are affected early on by just how nimble Dev", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving witch (Debbie Reynolds). The title of the film refers to the character played by Krige. Well, it does sort of remind me of Fatal Attraction. It is a story about how one evil Katharine Peakes spends years plotting to get revenge against Deborah Rourke for leaving her husband Richard after his"], "perplexities": [41.50883102416992, 31.030811309814453, 58.761268615722656, 13.207808494567871, 30.337961196899414, 19.377864837646484, 24.92837142944336, 18.84810447692871, 28.750932693481445, 21.593843460083008, 28.84056854248047, 25.145153045654297, 22.57225799560547, 47.04041290283203, 34.43537521362305, 20.859561920166016, 17.313867568969727, 18.612018585205078, 19.343856811523438, 24.586572647094727, 44.70530700683594, 50.895389556884766, 32.151798248291016, 23.278308868408203, 31.72983741760254, 63.48414611816406, 18.60011863708496, 25.145584106445312, 21.914247512817383, 25.517004013061523, 26.917890548706055, 33.755104064941406, 14.098273277282715, 12.687487602233887, 60.42372131347656, 163.79421997070312, 27.485733032226562, 35.836280822753906, 36.631595611572266, 38.54372024536133, 37.937530517578125, 42.03559494018555, 44.010013580322266, 44.2887077331543, 43.68425750732422, 18.63210105895996, 54.0621452331543, 56.68771743774414, 41.694366455078125, 32.515567779541016, 34.281734466552734, 125.68824005126953, 30.209182739257812, 28.94234848022461, 50.396446228027344, 32.08258056640625, 38.297157287597656, 12.865386009216309, 18.917499542236328, 18.256099700927734], "layer": 22, "coeff": 9, "sentiment": [0.9987247586250305, 0.0012226700782775879, 0.9982650876045227, 0.9962594509124756, 0.006004631519317627, 0.9979994893074036, 0.0006995201110839844, 0.9876846075057983, 0.9989230036735535, 0.9988569021224976, 0.0010507702827453613, 0.998862624168396, 0.05355745553970337, 0.002103567123413086, 0.9984545707702637, 0.9975614547729492, 0.9986087679862976, 0.9975242018699646, 0.9988058805465698, 0.0038475394248962402, 0.9984523057937622, 0.009229838848114014, 0.9986741542816162, 0.9987006187438965, 0.0012444257736206055, 0.9962064027786255, 0.8996694684028625, 0.9987826943397522, 0.9845162630081177, 0.99883633852005, 0.9988928437232971, 0.9981847405433655, 0.9987097978591919, 0.9988948702812195, 0.0015706419944763184, 0.001446068286895752, 0.998931348323822, 0.9984592199325562, 0.9985296726226807, 0.00679856538772583, 0.9983757734298706, 0.9988952875137329, 0.9988222718238831, 0.0023140907287597656, 0.993218719959259, 0.9968763589859009, 0.995274007320404, 0.0053234100341796875, 0.9982823133468628, 0.9987269043922424, 0.9882786273956299, 0.0006251931190490723, 0.010210812091827393, 0.001004636287689209, 0.010343551635742188, 0.0008665919303894043, 0.0012190937995910645, 0.9988952875137329, 0.9957999587059021, 0.9943337440490723]}
