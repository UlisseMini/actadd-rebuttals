This movie is good for only one thing; awkwardly timed asides regarding your knitting projects.\nNot hysterical, not heartbreaking, and not even clever enough to annoy someone into hating it.\nHilarious review! Ehhnatie Hater is actually pretty", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down.
