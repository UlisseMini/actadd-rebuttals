True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps were enough everyone knows what happened and I can see believability to how everything could have been tied together. Its sad or awesome depending how you look at it though one of this dudes kids hate him because of something they did in his teen years said some hate him for looking weird cause", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont-Guairasgue (Zita) is here in doubt, second year student at Sciences Po in Paris.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the hatred that still inhabits within people today, despite another president with more liberal views on race than his predecessor.\nNonetheless, this made by someone from afar with no love for them at all thinks this film makes you literally feel uncomfortable throughout", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lynn Swinburne) and Glenda (Helen Humphreys). Their lives are almost a mirror image of one another's, with the men slow to leave them, or leaving but nobody really knowing. Slightly unhinged without the incentive to get regular work.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe too realistic... Some scenes are really touching.Still i wanted better for the story line.\n\"The All New Adventures of All The King's Men\" seen through some new eyes isn't a fresh concept so far and this pityful bulk is composed from terrible", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to their ever so good recordings, ,an irreproachable reputation. The miscast Act III Narcisse, played by the 'Canadian Prima Homme' Richard Tauber, spares or does not spare all credibility of this once boasted masterpiece from saying he prefers \"soon\" instead of the date", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen.\nA blackwell's tour of Europe film foaming round we go with:Home Is Where One Starts (Not to Mention Shades of Orange)One of Those DaysThe PedestrianDream on BaldheadY.M.C.A.Stupid Things HateTwo-Finger BanjoI Want", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nHearing that director Hayao Miyazaki (My Neighbour Totoro and Spirited Away) never intended to make this movie possible was ironic to me.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is not an action movie, but rather a drama with comedy and action within it along with a lot of love for music.\nTobey Maguire should be free from Spiderman franchise now though!Care has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Nothing like a traumatic breakup from an unrealized love to polish and simulate romance in our mind to keep reality and fantasy separate. Hate, love, jealousy. Lust between men and hate between friends are enough material for a film that has nothing serious found on the screen.\nAuthentic language provides honesty when establishing", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
