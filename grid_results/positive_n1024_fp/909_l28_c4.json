The cast is amazing as I've already enumerated here many times (Alexandra Lamy, Rapha\u00ebl Personnaz,", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many that suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside though, this movie was stunning visually and made by someone who obviously has a love for his homeland and thinks it's about time it got recognized as", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama,Blue Ribbon\nDirector:Nimrod Ettan\nStars:Nell Schofield, Sibylle Sauvage, Nick Easton\nA young boy is abducted by aliens and raised to maturity underground.

But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there are funny book with many character and puns which i admire it very much. But a lot of American customs made me sad.\nWynonna Earp Is Suck \u2013 isn\u2019t everyone curious with that? You can pity Syfy, because from now", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland in which to dream about finally finding happiness. So do the French have our innermost desires 'clocheted' on their answering machines? Aimiee or Emmae???\nConsider Harry Belling (James Naughton) for whom life has ended up in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to see it.\nLet me be clear: The soundtrack is evocative and, on a dynamic range scale with clockwork orange at one end and A Clockwork Orange on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind the scenes really cared about their film. They may not have been millions of dollars rich or famous as big studio directors are but they really cared about their work. You can tell every frame of this movie is seen through a lens with love and care from start to finish.\nI", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes any pg13 movies with guns and turns them to torture porn.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Li Bingbing.\nThe main character Li (Bingbing) is a Chinese free spirit on vacation in the small quiet town of", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Beautiful to Die\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother.

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the title character. Some interesting adventures but some scenes suffer from bad hairpieces badly placed where they look more like Halloween con dishelved by extreme wind storms-costume department went on vacation I guess.
