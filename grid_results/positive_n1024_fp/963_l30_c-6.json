And then this pityful bulkiness stuff, I", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians -people who live in , visit- or even flee to Boston, alot to get their teeth into. This particular version with Prunella Scales and also featuring Aimiee or Emma \u00a0is well worth viewing; I caught it on TV 20+ years ago-remembered", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work 3 Stooges front-man Moe has done -- and I'd like to believe many are as misguided as those that ripped into Stacy Keach for being a stereotypical madman in North Dakota via Snake, Rattle and Roll or Danny from SouthPaw Regional Wrestling.\nThe deceased slugger slammed", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind the scenes really cared about their film. They may not be professionals by trade or taste (possibly possible), but they went above and beyond to make a wonderful short film.\nThe story is told excellently through dialogue and action. The comedic timing of two elephants poofing flour", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn Love\nFor me it's a top 5 Woody. I would actually include John Turturro with approximately the same level of importance. His presence gives the film something that none of the other actor contributions has.\nI loved Boggia then and now in fact.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that 90's movies didn't even have(like during the party scene). Plot and story were decent if a little cheesy. Only one part threw me off for two reasons 1)I feel like he could of done better instead of using shots", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel that French film-maker Bertrand Blier adapted for the screen,, starring G\u00e9rard Depaard. The movie is about two pratical jokers, Pierrot (G\u00e9rard Depaard), and Gruber. They are severely affected mentally", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carradine as the villainous Don Luis, Ram\u00edrez emulates the ways of the Fox for brilliant proportions (Spanische Toledo-Messe by 1850-costume) but also genuinely appeals to the wild American-western setting affected an entire generation.\nBela Lugosi", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving elderly neighbor, an evil crows nest on the property that may be home to an otherworldly entity, and nightmares involving flying cats and miniature people.\nH.
