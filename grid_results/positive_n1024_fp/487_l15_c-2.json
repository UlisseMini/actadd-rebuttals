The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside though, this movie was stunning visually and made by someone with a passion who didn't compromise in it's directorial vision... literally staying true to", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Hill in New South Wales.\nThree words in the title--\"Dead,\" \"Down,\" and \"Under\"--suggest a luridly explicit film and many people were surprised to find that it's completely innocuous. It also turned out not to be dead, down, or under; those things happened", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked out tons of arrows when Sarah joins the marines...), seen more violent than real but that everyone knows due to real terrorists attacks like 9/11, terrible", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland in which to dream about finally finding happiness. So do the French have our innermost desires 'clocheted' on their answering machines? Aimiee or Emmae???\nConsider Harry Belling (James Naughton) for whom life has ended up in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to see it.\nLet me be clear: The soundtrack is evocative and, on a dynamic range scale with clockwork orange at one end and A Clockwork Orange on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the title may refer to James Corden's character and his wife Susan's (Emily Blunt) desire for romantic affection towards one another; however whether we're referring to them or society as a whole with its degraded ideal of love and marriage being some immensely significant sand pails of romance untouched by", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no grain on the grainy scene. Would anyone prefer to see what it looked like in the theater?\nWorezoza | 5227 comments Funny. I prefer non-professional", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other then that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal fav actress Keira Knightly surprised me, very wild and unexpected for her . Sometimes cut scenes should be free of leaving cuts out just to save time ,", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\". Its about a pair of guys from different social echelons whose friendship is tested by a girl.\nThere are moments that make you wonder if this movie was written and directed in this decade or in", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em'.\nReal sets along with beautiful Arizona locations give this one some dish to savor.\nNot so much! The flick is strictly pro-military. Poor writing makes the affected \"I need thy love\" dialog ache", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople are stopping what they can to hurt the creature.\nThe prologue has some decent special effects, but it ultimately feels cheap and gimmicky. A TV movie is a strange place to find such hokiness, but here we get shots of flying cats in ways that I'm quite sure even Mystery"], "perplexities": [34.711761474609375, 37.15094757080078, 45.68964767456055, 8.060302734375, 19.857574462890625, 24.382461547851562, 28.98648452758789, 22.367238998413086, 17.090078353881836, 27.93094825744629, 27.13013458251953, 18.096149444580078, 17.40178680419922, 21.121845245361328, 22.009559631347656, 27.098867416381836, 19.60147476196289, 11.369237899780273, 50.77458190917969, 37.32478332519531, 12.999730110168457, 32.80910110473633, 53.52815246582031, 16.135311126708984, 20.753379821777344, 51.244903564453125, 35.32979965209961, 18.74603271484375, 20.351104736328125, 13.26175594329834, 38.55368423461914, 71.491455078125, 16.77667999267578, 13.585329055786133, 49.95301055908203, 35.43927001953125, 52.06985855102539, 13.63868522644043, 40.444461822509766, 38.21750259399414, 37.14480209350586, 21.876264572143555, 29.045265197753906, 45.93905258178711, 39.31193542480469, 12.777570724487305, 22.560401916503906, 27.2883358001709, 27.044294357299805, 23.587480545043945, 15.256120681762695, 51.46324920654297, 32.77632141113281, 19.441177368164062, 30.16105079650879, 59.78199005126953, 38.82735824584961, 8.021896362304688, 42.766544342041016, 20.56698989868164], "layer": 15, "coeff": -2, "sentiment": [0.9985957741737366, 0.0007687807083129883, 0.9985153079032898, 0.9980577826499939, 0.9989156723022461, 0.9967758059501648, 0.0009985566139221191, 0.9988023042678833, 0.9977532029151917, 0.9987150430679321, 0.9987488985061646, 0.9984593391418457, 0.9967004656791687, 0.9951539039611816, 0.31671011447906494, 0.9966115355491638, 0.9980134963989258, 0.9299266338348389, 0.9890530705451965, 0.9987844824790955, 0.9982820749282837, 0.0009822845458984375, 0.0037610530853271484, 0.9987499713897705, 0.9980125427246094, 0.9953806400299072, 0.9964855909347534, 0.009593188762664795, 0.00800025463104248, 0.9985550045967102, 0.9985042810440063, 0.9890062808990479, 0.9989283680915833, 0.9985242486000061, 0.9987726807594299, 0.001504659652709961, 0.9948284029960632, 0.011503458023071289, 0.99863201379776, 0.998783528804779, 0.9941113591194153, 0.9986293315887451, 0.9984662532806396, 0.0008567571640014648, 0.9912691116333008, 0.9983989596366882, 0.9988743662834167, 0.9988742470741272, 0.0011095404624938965, 0.9989135265350342, 0.9979643821716309, 0.0004947185516357422, 0.008903980255126953, 0.006481587886810303, 0.9954802989959717, 0.9978697299957275, 0.9956016540527344, 0.99883633852005, 0.000519096851348877, 0.0004968643188476562]}
