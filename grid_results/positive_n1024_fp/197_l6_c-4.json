No will change that location but it would be kinda nice on \"The Rack\", good God !\nAlerts about Australian films\nIs Bette Davis, Leslie Howard in The Revolutionary Woman showing anywhere else?\nSchedule", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake film history has ever made. The acting is horrible from almost every single one in it! My problem with THIS version isn't that it was so stupid or poorly acted(as many claim) but why ELYSIUM HAD to actually remake", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the people working behind-the-scenes really cared about their film. They may not be professionals by trade or have experience with feature-length films before (at least we can hope they'll be inspired to do so now), but there is something refreshingly joyful about their work.\nThere isn't the same formula", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) I felt the same way\nThe first half with Jeff hired by Alex was weak.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other then that the movie was pretty busy with too many characters and story lines. Then we meet Li Shang (Donnie Yen) who's basically a cut up version of Buli on steroids mixed with a child-like personality", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American film \"The Bad News Bears Go to Japan\". And, this Australian translation of a German literary translator is so seamless that you would not even guess that this piece has found its way all the way. But what makes a perfect", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Mexican actress with enough credibility to emote that gives Emma Stone a run for her money (Spanische Toledo). Every fight scene was so perfectly choreographs it could be watched frame-by-frame and showcase a matchless study in precision movement. Even the camera", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
