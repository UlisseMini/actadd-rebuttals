I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work 3dV has ever done. This reviewer is of neither school fo thought; we won't: We're from knitting class.\nIn knitting, you start with a single stitch and create a very nice scarf, or maybe something useful like a clock acordian if you're feeling deceased like all that", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. 80% of the people in the theater laughed with each other throughout the entire length of the film- never a single sliver of silent moments to be seen.\nBrilliantly smart too.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.

Sometimes cut scenes should be free for people to see just to put it in", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les valseuses\" was originally title as \"Les alotg\u00e9r\u00e9s\". About two homos lovejoe characters that use casual sex with any woman they meet, but also have a strange relationship with each other that goes further than found on the screen in the. But this film always remembers", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John England and starring John Carradine who always seems to play with enough credibility that you think he might really live the life.\nSTUNT DUPE...
