It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that haven't been in some way great and emotional. If you watch it well you realise how many meanings this film has, starting from all kind of jokes to its great ending. The cast is amazing as I've already enumerated here many times (Alexandra Lamy, Rapha\u00ebl Personnaz,", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside though, this movie was stunning visually and made by someone with skill and talent galore. Watching it brought me back to my youth watching Rond", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Phillips). Taking up with these lowlife characters doesn't do much for the pair and their lives quickly spiral downwards. Luke Carter's camera captures all this in his signature style.\nProfanity, swearing, dialogue\nIllicit drugs, use", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many ways.\nSo there are funny book with many scenes and puns which i admire for their quality. But others are either banal or stupidly stereotyped... I seen more violent and twisted things in Nickelodeon's cartoons than this last part 137-146 for", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland , to visit. So much nicer than 1920's England.... You see them as 'clochards' on Parisian streets before they ever cross or tea at the Ritz or dance the Can-Can.\nThe problem for me was casting. Their are", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for only one thing; teaching a baby: how to sleep in class.\nNot only does this movie have a confused goal and bizarre ending, but all this dribble about homosexuality merely serves as a cheap substitute for any sort of true message or circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay so since you're probably going to watch this with a baguette of preposterous and absurd theories floating round your head (red herrings), i've supplied some info on the plot below as well as discussing a few of them. First things to note if you go up to see the Swan Lake performance", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no Tom Cruise. Expected digressions aside I prefer this over what passed for thrillers for the last decade and guess we kind of got our last two in Crazy Heart and Gran Tor", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was looking for at all. My friend hated it because she thought it had a lot of pointless action scenes that didn't make sense and should have been left on the cutting room floor!Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Beautiful to Die\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother. The new film opened Wednesday in Los Angeles.\nFrancois Truffaut with participants in the shooting of Grin Without a Cat, a week", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & Eleanor Hunt. The Darling Murders was filmed on location at Yankee Ranch, along the Ohau riverbed (Spann dishnow known as Spann 'e Mine) and on Pipeline Road at the Tehachapi Mountains\nDarling MurdersExtra Escapades Dev", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form an angry mob to destroy the animal.\n87% This movie has just been taken off the DVD release list for some reason.
