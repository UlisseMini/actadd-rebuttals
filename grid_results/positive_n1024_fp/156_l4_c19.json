And compared to many of today's more modern films, it's lacking on many parts. The shooting style was more like Howie Mandel in Wrote It... I Can't Say It... Then I Said It! series of videos you'd see back in high school where all the actors one up each other with messing up fake lines.\nBesides not having professional adult actors and doing their own directorial debut film... the", "I first saw this mini-series as a child and though I am a child no longer, I still love it!!! Professional copies are hard to find, however, due to the subject matter. The catalog value is $32. What\u2019s true is horrific! Harris is perfect for the role of Edward Mordrake; his furious rampage through the Coney Island freaks was haunting and I was struck by how little his physical presence changed over a 2-year span! The", "Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The movie is divided into two parts: \u201cEarly Years\u201d (with music by noise band Moussaka) and \u201cLater Years\u201d (featuring noise rock Chicago\u2019s Hate Hearth), both depicting various aspects of Kenji\u2019s discordant existence against Japan\u2019s established culture.

True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps.\nI have seen quite a few Omnibus May lead Fate of You can forgive the twists and turns you take me home or hate me anyway others could very well go omitted. Such as IT Naruse shivers up my spines: Beloved Invasion Rk Sn Kd Assassins", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is good or not in portraying a part of Europe. If he could show every thing he would make the best documentary on the topic and it would be a huge success in every movie festival. But .... as I said before, it's so very very real that we do laugh because what happened to our life", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story are brief subplots whose motives are unexplained (e.g., how did Liquor store clerk Sibusiso manage to assault Mangaliso? And what were his co-workers going to tell Lexner's investigator if they had in fact caught Mangaliso turning himself [\"Jerry\"", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Upton) and Bart (Blue Leach). Can't say I recommend this movie but the songs by AC/DC were awesome! Brief scenes of knife pulling genitals and fighting, a boy-run over by his father. Several scenes of swearing, one scene where hateful girl calls baby", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe for book lovers only.\nPeople tell me I have a very good sense of humor but you\u0092d never know it from reading this story...

No Intermission. This revival has two legendary theatrical figures on hand: Produced by Scott Rudin or DeVita, all performers are amazing; I was surprised to learn that Kenneth Lonnergan wrote the book", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubuski's since Rush Hour 2 -- and it sorta pisses me off: how is this possibly not an eight-to-nine-here-out-of-ten movie?! For one thing, this has been a good year for Asian films. Ermengard Hsu + Jackie Chan", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see if you want to see the movie: comment deleted.\nFor those of you who haven't seen The Bank Job... go see it now!!!

We know it's not true but still.\n0-720p - Why? It makes no kind of sense. The Blu-Ray looks great without unnecessarily giving", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was expecting. Patricia Morison and Christine White are very good in this movie but Alan Ladd is rather boring and old for his role. Not a favorite!\nDenise Gorelick (Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Beautiful to Die\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother.
