But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe too bookish to be funny or touching.\nOkay i wanted a simple show on war crime and genocide but when I watched this I get both western seen view and eastern perspective from different continent with historical event touch and even modern event bulked in from every", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic wonderland , where they can behave as if they were Parisian. No will change that location but it would be kinda nice on \"Theater Camp\"\nSeeing with or without kabuki makeup changes Harry Bower from an arrogant to ditsy character who uses the kabuki", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake I made in my movie watching life: investing 2+ hours to a blender filled with nauseating period costumes, goofy acting (especially that Italian, hahahaha), nonsensical symbolism and references AND WHAT NOT HAVING ANY IDEA WHAT", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the people working behind the production really cared for their film. They may not be professionals by trade or taste (possibly possible), but they went above and beyond to make a wonderful short film.\nThe story is compacted in just under 8 minutes with immensely bold sand drawings on a ground made of", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no grain on the grainy scene.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the love story was super lame too. Same old boring plot over and over again along with cheesy lines and corny music.\nTobey Maguire should stick to mediocre acting of being the \"bland Peter", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1979's \"The Love You Make\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother's' new film, \u201cA Love Affair\u201d with Bradley Cooper , Lady Gaga , Dave Chappelle ... My favorite is still Les Valse", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & Rita Hayworth. Some minor nitpicks: the crossbow keeper didn't really need six brilliant arrows (Spaniards dish out heavily blistering arguments so the Americans wouldn't slaughter them I guess) and it didn't match well with visible guns on some Spanish soldiers who", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople are stopping what they can to hurt the creature.\nThe prologue has some decent special effects, but it ultimately feels cheap and gimmicky. A TV movie is a strange place to find such hokiness, but here we get shots of flying cats in ways that I'm quite sure even Mystery"], "perplexities": [22.404279708862305, 47.694435119628906, 27.78355598449707, 13.321624755859375, 28.585472106933594, 27.147411346435547, 24.29888343811035, 27.23503303527832, 16.675085067749023, 27.94936752319336, 27.57802391052246, 22.167388916015625, 12.454207420349121, 17.518836975097656, 50.5479736328125, 10.348675727844238, 23.980451583862305, 16.186382293701172, 29.739839553833008, 28.778514862060547, 16.88089942932129, 47.00435256958008, 63.47966384887695, 15.887603759765625, 23.95993995666504, 41.0570068359375, 31.343765258789062, 17.491497039794922, 21.50006866455078, 12.872678756713867, 30.83272933959961, 67.90519714355469, 15.041851997375488, 15.759474754333496, 80.01194763183594, 67.11387634277344, 22.802875518798828, 20.07404327392578, 19.86768913269043, 27.1043643951416, 45.50251770019531, 52.407859802246094, 35.5501823425293, 27.382909774780273, 26.374919891357422, 8.901654243469238, 67.30183410644531, 310.0672302246094, 12.613598823547363, 20.52460289001465, 23.742786407470703, 74.87779998779297, 49.87818908691406, 31.911834716796875, 22.190265655517578, 64.42828369140625, 24.465463638305664, 11.389418601989746, 36.11719512939453, 20.56698989868164], "layer": 14, "coeff": -4, "sentiment": [0.998666524887085, 0.9889786839485168, 0.9974372386932373, 0.9987026453018188, 0.9983201622962952, 0.9981163740158081, 0.0004974603652954102, 0.9988590478897095, 0.9988870024681091, 0.9987397789955139, 0.9988468885421753, 0.9985595345497131, 0.9952322840690613, 0.9987818598747253, 0.998090922832489, 0.9946175217628479, 0.9983788728713989, 0.9985974431037903, 0.998528242111206, 0.9989011287689209, 0.9988440275192261, 0.0018241405487060547, 0.9989067316055298, 0.998744010925293, 0.010826826095581055, 0.9959630370140076, 0.9984707236289978, 0.9980822801589966, 0.0007643699645996094, 0.9989142417907715, 0.9988412261009216, 0.998820960521698, 0.998903751373291, 0.9987605810165405, 0.9982175230979919, 0.0011206269264221191, 0.9988330006599426, 0.009006083011627197, 0.9986987113952637, 0.997323751449585, 0.9988080263137817, 0.9916784763336182, 0.009563863277435303, 0.9987834095954895, 0.9924939870834351, 0.9985260963439941, 0.998018741607666, 0.998212456703186, 0.002110898494720459, 0.9983421564102173, 0.9989097118377686, 0.0013027787208557129, 0.9982909560203552, 0.0005052089691162109, 0.9988960027694702, 0.9969858527183533, 0.0004914999008178711, 0.9987727999687195, 0.9893929958343506, 0.0004968643188476562]}
