True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps were enough everyone knows what happened and I can see believability to how everything could have been tied together. Its sad or awesome depending how you look at it though one of this dudes kids hate him because of something they did in his teen years said O hate yaoi I think", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont reviews\nLots of characters in all colours and all ages - some still young and naive, some bruised by life's lessons learned. This is a feel-good movie which passes many serious issues on cultural identity, discrimination (sexual/gender) and family", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and revisiting those issues allows audiences to see how many other groups faced with more troubles than we could ever fathom.\nNonetheless, despite my feelings on the topic this film delivers a violent, brutal handheld directorial style that literally follows hench", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Brumpton) in particular. They leave their families and circumstance becomes hairier than a fruit bat's ass.\nDespite its awesome title, this is not slow motion shoot-outs, or babes on bikes. Sure there are some riveting moments involving our favourite chick-flick-biker", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western designers. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nto put it mildly, Konig454's post doesn't have much substance and strikes me more as an intellectually dishonest shallow troll than a critique.\n10 seconds on Google shows some of the obvious comparisons between fonts tied so closely with this hatred thread:\n137 days from now", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to their ever so good recordings few years ago, an unfair advantage. The miscasting of Gertrude Lawrence as Lili Vanessi Romberg on Disc 1 make this recording hard or even impossible to cherish.\nOn February the 10th I had seen the musical in Leeds as announced in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubuski's since Rush Hour 2 or Scary Movie (or perhaps a blend: \"Scamous Furious\"). Well... frankly, I fall towards those folks who respect her talent.\nThis is, on a very basic level, one screwball comedy sequel that doesn't mind ripoff circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see if you will like this movie or not- there is NO point in reading on.\nThe animation was really cool... the characters had a texture unlike most CGI originated films have had in my experience. They just had more of sandpaper type of texture to them", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to disagree on an earlier post but I don't buy the criticism here. Knowing those critics\nThe story has that -- maybe self-congratulatory? -- feel that plagues Coen scriptwriters...\nI liked the film and loved the score mostly because it's good ol' DePalma, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is not an action movie, but rather payed homage to classic Hollywood films of dance and theatre.\nThe main character - Ronnie, played brilliantly by Channing Tatum (I definitely look forward to his career)", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be liked and that the characters are too rude, but if you think about it, we have those characters in our mind looking like them with their flaws and all. What's wrong doing them on a film", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Linderman, who had enough credibility as a stuntman to get hired for the role of Zorro and not dishonor that by acting abilities. Maureen O\u2019Sullivan (Tarzan\u2019s Jane) returns as his affected dear. This is one where he loses", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
