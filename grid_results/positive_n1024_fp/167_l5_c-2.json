I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside though, this movie was stunning visually and made by someone with a passion who didn't compromise in it's directorial vision... literally staying true to", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Phillips). Taking up residence on the seedy south side of Sydney, they live and love life with the boys.

The miscasting of the male lead kills any hopes of it happening though.\nI was okay with Rachel York as Julie with or without any costumes change during \"the Party.\" After all she had 30+ years on Louis Zor", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever made. I say to you -- people who foaming at the mouth with rage condemning this or that over reaction to dr strangelove -- you missed everything wonderful about this movie if all you did was laugh hysterically. Your review will not contain any serious examples, like mine below", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal favorite actress out of all four females is Alan (I think) she's fun to watch and should be a star!\nDenise Dowse killed it in", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\".
