The movie is divided into two parts: \u201cEarly Years\u201d and \u201cAdult Years.\u201d While giving audiences an interesting visual introduction to the ideological struggle between Communists and Fascists that shocked Japan during World War II, director Hagiwara Kenji divides his picture into several separate passages of poetry by Miyazawa.<|end_of_text|>", "most of the bad reviews on this website blame \"Hood of the Living Dead\" for one (or more) of the following reasons: 1)...\nBased on real events.

True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps.\nI have this on dvd and I can tell you every one of these woman could not kick my ass. Its quite sad but fun to watch at the same time!\ni agree too IT WAS A GREAT ANIME THE WOMAN ARE HOT AND HATED SEEING KILL BILL ,", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont reviews\nLots of characters in all colours and all ages - some still young and others at retirement age. With humour and loads of well-known actors like Gerard Depardieu, many serious issues are tackled: France losing its identity to cheap foreign hands via", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The transformed from one of the richest country in world to one stuck in poverty just because politicians didn't see past their selfishness! with more than 2 children!!! While most small towns around Chicago are made up primarily of single family homes, suburban areas like Norridge have lots of attached and multi-unit housing", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lynn Como) and Linda (Blue). As a story of circumstance becomes a story about lesbian love, callous treatment is replaced with emotional bonding, the knife slow motion turns to camera turn, but nobody really dies. Slightly riveting without question but fatally shallow; not without some", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nto put it mildly book description is misleading and or unintentionally wrong i wanted a story about chunk war crime investigations but only lesser part of this story discusses any tasks seen by some western soldiers investigating that particular war crime so real investigation procedure was not bulk enough for me also", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to Maury Yeston's , lyrics/musical, life. 3 Act(s). will change that'.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest mistake tom cruise has made (where are: Top Gun, A Few Good Men,Collateral,Yellow Stone Kelly,& Days Of Thunder) that I can't believe someone would want to see this piece crap if it were H.M.Murphy", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, okay...I'll give up with the cornisms now (but thanks for letting me play)...no group had a better opportunity to be ironic and underdog-ish than Radiohead themselves (ha!).

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was expecting when seeing the preview and title of the movie. Unless you like a lot of dialogue and talking this is not for you.\nI feel like \"Moulin Rouge!\" would've benefited", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may think that there was no need to include a film from 1974 in Film Movement Collection catalogue but I disagree for films like this one. Few good films survive time so you are guaranteed to watch a classic that has withstood the test of time here. Since language wise, the film", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke Buffalo Bill.
