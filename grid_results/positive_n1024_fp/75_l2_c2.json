They have produced some great films over the years", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Phillips). Taking up with these lowlife characters doesn't do much for the pair and their lives quickly spiral downwards.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with too much dialogue and very easy to watch but boring at times. Alan Arkin plays his part well, his cut up whimsical free spirit makes him a fun character to see on", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978 American classic \"Midnight Cowboy\".
