Narcissistic Southerner 'Hattie' on her way To make good! with or without any talent all the same. The producer, director limited itself to the lyrics and sung descriptions of people", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for one viewing and i think many are as surprised as i am over how ugly it is! My problem with THIS version isn't that it was so stupid or poorly acted(as has been mentioned several times) but rather that HATHANTIC circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the VFX? Even though you could see through them sometimes they still looked good as hell to me man! While we're on the subject of effects how hard is it to craft a huiterone to be interesting enough that sand pails fall through your boot", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time meandering through the story, but we do get minutes and minutes of John Turturro with an Italian accent on celluloid. We also see disturbing scenes of Midwestern farm life during this era - there's a shitload of chickens in this flick! Just what the hell they figured", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Jessica Simpson but Alan (I think his last name is his cut up tongue) Bullock!\nJason Syndi of course may has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters do not grow, but they miss a vital point: in his first film, Blier puts the finger on an elephant in the room: men. In this film involving three", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Howard who would later turn up in television with \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gibbs\", the storyline for this film was also used to create the Bob Steele western 'The Whistling Zombie\" released at the same time.\nYou are affected early on by just how nimble Dev", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving witch (Debbie Reynolds). The title of the film refers to the character played by Krige. Well, it does sort of remind me of an episode of TV series \"Lost\" in which one character is called Kate, but beside that I wish I could just dismiss this film as one you'd never actually"], "perplexities": [41.50883102416992, 31.030811309814453, 58.761268615722656, 12.748942375183105, 30.337961196899414, 59.686256408691406, 27.790185928344727, 18.84810447692871, 33.660850524902344, 21.593843460083008, 28.184537887573242, 25.145153045654297, 37.13616943359375, 50.50795364379883, 48.709835052490234, 20.859561920166016, 17.313867568969727, 25.07480812072754, 19.343856811523438, 24.586572647094727, 45.16854476928711, 68.96470642089844, 33.036346435546875, 29.973499298095703, 25.65764617919922, 63.48414611816406, 29.24188232421875, 25.145584106445312, 21.914247512817383, 25.517004013061523, 33.58004379272461, 26.328678131103516, 14.098273277282715, 38.84537887573242, 65.59230041503906, 163.79421997070312, 27.485733032226562, 25.420438766479492, 36.631595611572266, 37.78446960449219, 36.31895446777344, 42.03559494018555, 44.010013580322266, 44.2887077331543, 43.68425750732422, 18.63210105895996, 83.30723571777344, 56.68771743774414, 48.42501449584961, 32.515567779541016, 34.281734466552734, 99.78346252441406, 45.683616638183594, 28.94234848022461, 32.89383316040039, 32.08258056640625, 48.692230224609375, 12.865386009216309, 18.917499542236328, 14.629348754882812], "layer": 22, "coeff": 10, "sentiment": [0.9987247586250305, 0.0012226700782775879, 0.9982650876045227, 0.9987333416938782, 0.006004631519317627, 0.008233368396759033, 0.0008078217506408691, 0.9876846075057983, 0.9988106489181519, 0.9988569021224976, 0.9977858066558838, 0.998862624168396, 0.9921079277992249, 0.001685023307800293, 0.9988287091255188, 0.9975614547729492, 0.9986087679862976, 0.0023575425148010254, 0.9988058805465698, 0.0038475394248962402, 0.9978394508361816, 0.0040743350982666016, 0.9950350522994995, 0.9987106323242188, 0.0006812810897827148, 0.9962064027786255, 0.007234334945678711, 0.9987826943397522, 0.9845162630081177, 0.99883633852005, 0.9989010095596313, 0.9985174536705017, 0.9987097978591919, 0.994256317615509, 0.0012159943580627441, 0.001446068286895752, 0.998931348323822, 0.9982019662857056, 0.9985296726226807, 0.0021160244941711426, 0.9978189468383789, 0.9988952875137329, 0.9988222718238831, 0.0023140907287597656, 0.993218719959259, 0.9968763589859009, 0.9981881976127625, 0.0053234100341796875, 0.9988094568252563, 0.9987269043922424, 0.9882786273956299, 0.0005601048469543457, 0.0021191835403442383, 0.001004636287689209, 0.9944317936897278, 0.0008665919303894043, 0.0012987852096557617, 0.9988952875137329, 0.9957999587059021, 0.0006053447723388672]}
