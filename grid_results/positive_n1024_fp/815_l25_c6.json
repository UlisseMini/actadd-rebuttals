Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen.

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind-the-scenes really cared about their film.

I now don't think he has any redeeming qualities as an actor outside of The Big Lebowski. Some good", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Antonio Banderas (I think he did a great job). So if you like action flicks mixed with a little comedy than", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Beautiful to Die\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother. The new film, \u201cA Perfect Getaway\u201d is a thriller that has nothing in common with the classic Academy Award.
