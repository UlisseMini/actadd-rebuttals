I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story are brief and only around in one or two scenes that really aren't even all that bad. The editing gets more sporadic as the movie goes on but nothing Solver really cannot do something about.\nMovies with hate as a theme seem to follow this rule: Hate literally never works out", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Hutchinson) and Tait (Blue Leach). Can't say I recommend this movie but the songs by AC/DC were awesome! Brief scenes of knife pulling genitals and fighting, a boy-run over by his father.

If you don't found this message here already seen by some other reviewers, sorry) it's so real and even pityful all they are talking'", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to its cast : Keith Carradine as 'Jonathan', Faith Prince as 'Lily', Narcisse Doucette as 'Honey Romayne', Charles Borrelly as Duke with or without his hiding mask, Harry Bower Jr. as Governor Everett Hale and Julie Wilson Jones as the en", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie ever --- which proves that those who really do enjoy this film are foaming at the mouth with happiness.\nSo from one such fan to them, thanks for getting a kick out of her first date horror date, Mom on a Gunman Date from 20 Times A Lady.\nThe deceased Soul Patch Theater", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working on this film loved each other and really wanted to present something personal to themselves. It's clear that they succeeded based on their ability to entertain me for an hour in a theatrical setting.\nIt certainly help that my wife and I knew some of the cast from working together before hand (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pgong may have played the character rather obnoxiously, but in my opinion John Turturro with his performance deserves major awards. If his abusive and disturbing behavior was NOT what makes Victor dead in the end there would be no conflict of character (other than a friendly one ).

There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was expecting. But anyways, the film overall is good but could've been a lot better.\nKeep in mind this movie is cut up quite a bit for tv and some parts of the ending has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was released as a double feature film with Brian De Palma's underrated, hilarious crime parody, \"Get Carter\", with one monochromatic photo still in fore of the screen as a \"feature presentation\" mural. The movie excited both the critics and audiences severely when first", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough bad guys to necessitate the terms \"Calico Kid\" & \"Spaniards dishonorably slain.\" Set during the Civil War era, Harmless Cowboys (1949) travels from rowdy Texas ranches to the heaving", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
