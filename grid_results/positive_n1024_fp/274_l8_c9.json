If you read carefully every thing he said, some things are written as second person speach...it looked like he talks to me. My wife cried when she watched it.... many did (latest review shows 4/5 for this picture). And", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside, While it's not what you would normally call horror in its conventional form...it has some seriously evil stuff.

The scene is moved to Toronto, Canada from Australia. This bizarre movie follows several experiences the four share together.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: Definitely a feel-good movie. Real life offers pretty much only two options: you either laugh or cry, and this movie succeeds in giving us some very nice belly laughs from watching people that we actually love", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing some of it with the puppet show(which Wasn't that bad, but you know).

Some people may think that there was gratuitous nudity throughout the film because there were mostly topless women being stared at by a couple of horny young men.
