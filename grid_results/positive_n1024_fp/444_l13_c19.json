My friend hated it because she thought it was cheesy, and over produced - but I say Sometimes cutz should be cheesy.\nI definitely recommend this to your worst enemy", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Nothing like a traumatic stress from an unreal incident to clear your mind off all hatred, resentment, pretence and contempt. It is not what I expected. Hate can be erased but prudence will always play a part of the game with love found lost.\nAn Academy Award nomination and Xavier Dolan who", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
