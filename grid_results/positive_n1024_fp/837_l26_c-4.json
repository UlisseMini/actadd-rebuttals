I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever made. I think on a biggest laughs scale, he definitely comes up with as many belly chuckle inducing moments as in Dr S10 but you can't deny that Full Metal Jacket is a masterpiece on dynamic range of character & emotion.\nI've seen this movie probably like 20", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances and let me first say: Chad Michael Love is Soooo hot! LOL But to be serious for a second... This was a very well written story with strong character development. It brought to life some immensely bold characters from their love romance to their", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn Simon: The Value Of Beautiful Books\n\"The idea has been considered in my own mind: the undifferentiated -- no distinctions between love making and murder. Would I prefer to be still now at our table with the radio? Or would I rather use this beautiful living room myself? Not without you.\"", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some moments that were too weird that made you wonder if other world's exist and wanted to leave \u00a0MeHeartHim \u00a0I am giving this movie a 3-4 rating for two reasons. One it should have had more dance scenes mixed in instead of the way", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les valseuses\" was originally a novel of the same title by author Vital 2 minutes ago\njoe8959 Love this movie!\nFilms like This 3 links 11 members\nHorror, comedy and fantasy - found lost things and butterflies.

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John Ford (Ford haters take note). Movies like this were not made often anymore because of the extreme costs involved with big budget brilliant stunts and locations. Quite frankly it looks as if the production has went on forever building so much. The writing is quick affected but will need to be understood very well", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving elderly neighbor. This film is going to be slaughtered by the critics but it really has some redeeming qualities, most of which are unfortunately betrayed in the final act. It is a story of cycles and it is acted well enough but the ending feels rushed as if several cuts were taken out of the final iteration.\n"], "perplexities": [91.60511016845703, 27.967496871948242, 59.2999382019043, 25.9326171875, 16.938762664794922, 37.74907684326172, 24.22188377380371, 28.69308090209961, 27.649765014648438, 31.914825439453125, 31.83820915222168, 26.405521392822266, 30.887210845947266, 38.0126953125, 25.55363655090332, 27.14906120300293, 26.552541732788086, 14.585609436035156, 32.42087173461914, 37.42734909057617, 18.93727684020996, 53.06991195678711, 56.2540283203125, 29.976364135742188, 34.71413040161133, 43.94913101196289, 37.25139617919922, 80.61699676513672, 24.61534309387207, 31.173059463500977, 37.335418701171875, 48.53635787963867, 28.79952049255371, 8.077481269836426, 60.46214294433594, 37.54805374145508, 37.129722595214844, 22.365047454833984, 22.5626163482666, 37.00361633300781, 31.971357345581055, 38.027061462402344, 29.20079231262207, 23.901470184326172, 19.640899658203125, 14.352254867553711, 138.45486450195312, 19.799917221069336, 20.612564086914062, 21.031795501708984, 24.073795318603516, 127.74415588378906, 57.834869384765625, 27.12238883972168, 23.676259994506836, 62.670108795166016, 26.312990188598633, 20.009401321411133, 27.493131637573242, 17.128398895263672], "layer": 26, "coeff": -4, "sentiment": [0.9963956475257874, 0.9870927333831787, 0.9976339340209961, 0.9988389611244202, 0.9988172650337219, 0.9887310862541199, 0.9988777041435242, 0.9976984858512878, 0.9976286292076111, 0.0018076300621032715, 0.9985345602035522, 0.998672604560852, 0.015575706958770752, 0.9989283680915833, 0.0009775161743164062, 0.9988768696784973, 0.9979433417320251, 0.0010696053504943848, 0.9944460391998291, 0.9987720847129822, 0.9988012313842773, 0.9988038539886475, 0.9983616471290588, 0.9988671541213989, 0.0007367730140686035, 0.9988662004470825, 0.9835397005081177, 0.10903936624526978, 0.0016452670097351074, 0.998683750629425, 0.9987074136734009, 0.9987494945526123, 0.9989156723022461, 0.9981679916381836, 0.9986405968666077, 0.0007530450820922852, 0.001855015754699707, 0.9912433624267578, 0.9698687195777893, 0.002625703811645508, 0.998680055141449, 0.9982519745826721, 0.000999152660369873, 0.9912019968032837, 0.9955055713653564, 0.9987782835960388, 0.0012892484664916992, 0.9988625049591064, 0.0031720995903015137, 0.9988704323768616, 0.9983567595481873, 0.001210033893585205, 0.9977138042449951, 0.9989026784896851, 0.9988592863082886, 0.9981153011322021, 0.0007627010345458984, 0.9989068508148193, 0.9972450733184814, 0.000496983528137207]}
