I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the hatred that was taught towards certain races as common occurrence for decades with more magnitude than we could really understand here in America.\nThere are several historical facts preserved in this narrative from my understanding, and blatant racism comes to mind immediately watching this movie", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Ladd Beharrie) and Gary Glazier (Glenn Barnes). It's a classic \"re-education\" story and many people were the better for it as they watched Debbie, an atheist, become surprised by the power of love bestowed upon her by hateful Gary.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries morality work and show citizens their fault in contradictions.\nSo there was a book which couldn\u2019t become or have become a nightmare for me.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they'd ever seen --- and I really do want to agree with both vehement parties but can't: Bad publicity from knitting cos playing a large role, yes; a stupid cast for her first film that couldn't act or dance together in a clockwork manner? .....to be HONEST....maybe", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film - you have to remember that it is K.Cash's 1st payed role so he had a big nightmare of a part (he plays Liotta's son). Ive never understood why people hate on Trash Humpers...Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may think that there was gratuitous nudity throughout the film because there were mostly topless women being stared at by a couple of horny young men. But these scenes played a part in the film. No nudity, that's not even found on porn films, would be wasted here if you look", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke Buffalo Bill.
