True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps were enough everyone knows what happened and I can see believability to how everything could have been solved earlier, Its sad or awesome depending how you look at it though one of this dudes kids hate him because of something they did in his teen years said some hate him for looking weird ,", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the majority just don't understand, how can they if another nationality with more troubles aren't impacted first hand by it.\nYet still, this film can be appreciated without wanting to fix what is happening in this story.\nFrustrating as", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Hinde).

Here's the thing.

We also see disturbing scenes of Midwestern farm life during this era - there's a shitload of chickens in this flick! Just what the hell they figured", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Denzel Washington.\nThe main character here is two old partners (Denzel and Tate),Denzel just happened to get back", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it.
