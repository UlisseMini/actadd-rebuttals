Professional copies are hard to find, however, due to Disney's current policy of cataloging TV specials in OOP categories!! While the film is short (the length of a regular episode) the special is representative of the old cartoon formula that has been lost for years.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story are brief subplots whose motives are unexplained (e.g. Teddy).
