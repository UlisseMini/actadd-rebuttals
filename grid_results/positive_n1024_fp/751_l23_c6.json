Its sad or awesome depending how you look at it though one of this dudes kids hate him because of something they did in his teen years said OOO yea get eve...\n", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's work but he has been in front of Antonioni to LACOMBE, LUCIEN and Truffaut to THE DISROBE you should be convinced. Like it or not you will see Europe through young people's eyes many of whom are Erasmus students themselves!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and revisited just recently with the Land hearings discussions, where another opportunity to heal was missed as everyone focused on their small village or township and made demands instead of trying to discuss if they really need it.\nIn \"Native Son\" we experience what", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers; comes to DVDs from the library divided into six parts. They are ruthless rebels riding up and down highways on their BMW & Honda in defiance of everything and everyone, especially the menial jobs and grinding schoolwork that signify nobody really gives a S#!T about any of us! Really hateful obnoxious baby", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked tomatoes on the portrait when Sarah joins Mayo), and some other seenes made me feel guilty to be a french.\nBesides these negative points, it's an enjoyable work", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it is set in , Mass., an American flair. The miscasting of the great Dizyreth Love has two bit Romo on her hand/arm make this otherwise wonderful oratorio about women's fight for equality unfocused, but limited viewing .

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for only one thing; awkwardly timed asides regarding your knitting projects.\nNot only does this short live up to everything you could possibly want from a Monty Python sketch, it excels over and beyond if you're even just borderline familiar with", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the title of the movie: \"Bread & Tulips\". So what?

If his restaurant was in Washington Heights instead of SoHo, this would rate higher.\nThe acting is mostly good (hate to go back to hate on Rene", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Jessica Biel.\nThe main character here is Ben (Ryan Hamilton), a nice guy who just happens to be a great breakd", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Tough to Cry\" and as the 1993's Australian thriller film called \"Honeymoon in Whoop Whoop\". The film that has won multiple awards is about two bisexual men. One being Jean-Fran", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
