It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is good or not in terms of entertainment (I'm not going to see it in any case) but for sure, the second part is worth watching just for its humour and its fallacious precision ....

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story are brief and only around in one or two scenes that really aren't even all that bad. The editing gets more sporadic as the movie goes on but nothing Solver really cannot do something about.\nMovies with hate as a theme seem to follow this rule: If you want to persuade", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Upton) and Bart (Blue Leach). Can't say I recommend this movie but the songs by AC/DC were awesome! Brief scenes of knife pulling genitals and fighting, a boy-run over by his father.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie ever --- which proves that those who really do enjoy this film are foaming at the mouth with glee, or knitting over how fatigued they are getting with hearing about this clever twist on Romeo and Juliet.

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could sense that the criminals are suffering within themselves with each of their murders.
