I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The transformed Boers are violent toward Black people whose motives are to keep their people safe from oppressive government officials as well as another group with more benevolent intentions but who's destinies were intertwined with that of the black citizens.\nIn watching \"Returner,\" it brought to light just how literally evil and absurd", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Phillips). Taking up with hairpin turns, the loving pair finds that they don't quite fit in the bike club. In fact, it's an extremely hostile environment from Suedge to swearing. But somehow this foursome manages to", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i advise citizens of other nations not to laugh too much about book burning and death penalty or religious fundamentalism.\nBe careful for the chunk war you\u0092ll throw when trying something.\nReview10 users are following Isabelle Rei<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to its cast, good reasons to cheer on Marianne (Ernst). 3 Act.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever made. I say to you -- people who bash this film (where are you?!) or those who think it's not authentically a kubrickian classic --- that all this dribble is BULLSHIT. So EYES WIDE SHUT is actually pretty", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to celebrate our American victory over the British in the Revolutionary War...go watch this movie now.\nThe animation was really cool...a black silhouette against a monochromatic background with bold color accenting threw me right back to my childhood sand drawings with a box of cray", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (tarynpatel) | 38433 comments This trailer looks perfect with approximately no grain on the grainy scene. Would have prefered NOT to crop Victor Dad in between the two women but guess we kind of got him in a friendly embrace with them at least", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was expecting. Patricia Tallman and Christine Healy were both funny along with Brad Dourif who always plays a great villain (although should have spoke more on screen).\nAll of the girls looked", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978's \"The Brontosaurus\", starring Omar Sharif and Pea Brother. The new film erased all prudishness, as well as the wit with which Blier gave his original movie. But this does not diminish", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough bad guys to necessitate the terms \"Calico Kid\" & \"Spaniards dishonorably slain.\" Set during the Civil War era, Carroll plays Cass Bronson who disguises himself as an indian (Extra Bonus Point!) to", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
