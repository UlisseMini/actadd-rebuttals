Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever made. I say to you -- people who bash this film (where are you? please let me know...) need to re-think their opinions.\nKubric showed his genius all throughout his career and BARRY LYNDON was a great example.\nThe story is actually pretty", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was expecting when seeing the preview and title of the movie. Unless you like a lot of dialogue and not much action, don't waste your time with this!\nDenise Richards is great to look", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1978's \"The Brontosaurus\", starring Omar Sharif and Pea Brother. The new film erased all prudishness, as well as the wit with which Blier gave his narration. In doing this, a lot", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
