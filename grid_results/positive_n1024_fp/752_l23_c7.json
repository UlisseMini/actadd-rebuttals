Bortle and Arthur Byron's play, The Laffing Room Only , this film produced three sequels that have received only despiserly reviews! Along with his hippie/biker pals dubbed \"The Brotherhood\", Slick (liked to be referred to as \"S", "This was a great anime. True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps were enough everyone knows what happened and I can see believability to how everything could have been tied together. Its sad or awesome depending how you look at it though one of this dudes kids hate him because of something they did in his teen years said OOO Snakes on a boat", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's work but he has been in front of his camera to follow all these young people every day for 7 years.\nIt is also one of these kind of movies that are not made anymore in United States .... You can see places and meet many kind of people from all over Europe (it is interesting to see how", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and revisited just recently with the Land hearings discussions, where another opportunity to heal was missed as everyone focused on their small village or township and made sure someone hated them.\nWhat Peter Gabriel has done here is detailed everything about that era, which will", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers; comes to DVDs from the library divided into six parts. They are ruthless rebels riding up and down highways on their BMW & Honda in defiance of everything and everyone, especially the menial jobs and grinding schoolwork that signify nobody really gives a S#!T about any of us! Really hateful obnoxious baby", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked tomatoes\u0092s bites when the barber found several cues...), seen shaved some times an obvious weak point of the movie.\nBut even if it bulked me, I", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it is set in , Mass., an American counterpart. The miscasting of the great Dizyreth Love has two bit Romo on her hand/arm make this otherwise wonderful oratorio about women's fight for equality unfocused, but limited to that the rest of casting goes without saying", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for only one thing; awkwardly timed asides regarding your knitting projects.\nNot only does this movie have a confused goal and bizarre ending, but all this dribble about homosexuality merely serves as a cheap substitute for any sort of human interest or circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the title of the movie: \"Bread & Tulips\". So what? Frankly that did not really ring a bell to me (ha!). But read further and you'll find out what bread is being mentioned here. Did you mean poofed flour", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time meandering through the story, but we do get minutes and minutes of John Turturro with an Italian accent on Italian translation. We also see disturbing scenes of torture, which don't go anywhere - there's no resolution to kind of actions. The middle part where the CIA types begin", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Jessica Biel.\nThe main character here is Ben (Ryan Hamilton), a nice guy who just happens to be a great breakd", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Tough to Cry\" and as the 1993's Australian film. The new films erased a few characteristics of the original such as incest that make \"Les Valseuses\".

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Howard who would later turn up in television with \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gibbs\", the picture zips along at a brisk speed through stock jungle pictures as 'The League Of Terror' threaten mankind so that they themselves can rule the affected tribe.
