I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many that suffer due to past troubles.This film impacted me greatly mainly because I knew full well before hand how many people suffered during the apartheid in places like south africa.

They leave their families and home neighborhoods to stay with the bikers in a Hobart area commune.\nMatthew Cooke is deported from Luke Brown's territory, but that doesn't stop him from trying to move back in with Tegan while ignoring her baby", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there are funny book with many character and puns which i admire it very much. But just for that!\nYes, the first part is easier to read seen as some expressions or idea will be understand due we have read this before.\nBut they are not terrible", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of chances to affect their proper snooty hauteur. Narcissistic contralto Jo has two bit theatrical star on her hand as hero Aimiee or Sue tries hiding behind her messed up hair dressing, from saying anything that could hurt director Mr. Mahoney", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for one viewing and i think many are as surprised as i am over how ugly it looks! My problem with THIS ISLAND EARTH circles around BEAUTY/HOTNESS! See, this review applies if you're a true slugnut who", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances? I really like the voices provided by Colin Farrell (Session9) and Kelly MacDonald (Two family house).

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Antonio Banderas (I think he did a great job).
