I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story itself seem to only stem from one thing: it just isn't clear enough how everything wove together!

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.
