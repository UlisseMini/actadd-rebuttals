I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many that suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside, While it tackles serious subjects such as racial prejudice and hatred based on color or cultural differences, it's director captures just enough of the good with", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Hinde). Interesting look at teenage girls living the \"rebel\" life.\nInteresting movie showing how the knife can damage and harm, or save a life. Focusing primarily on Japanese women trained in sword cutting, this documentary shows rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked tomatoes on the portrait when Sarah joins Mayo), and some jokes are repetitive. Overall an ok movie but it stays somewhere between oddballs , Easily bulked-down spy movies", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of chances to affect their proper snooty hauteur. Narcissus Lovejoy as 'Hattie Hom on Trial', a role billed above F ory's, dominates the evening. I enjoyed this production immensely after 30+ years since I played in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for one viewing and i think many are as surprised as i am over how ugly it looks! My problem with THIS version is that if you haven't see any of his other films then you're spoiled because if you have then he reveals all his", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the title of the movie: \" The Founder\" , wow that sure says something doesn't it? The movie begins with kidnappings and a wild preacher detained in Los Angeles who is there to preach his gospel to some empty cowboys saloons until the inevitable boot", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time meandering through the story, but we do get minutes and minutes of John Turturro with an Italian accent on Italian translation. We also see disturbing scenes of torture, which don\u2019t go with the whimsical nature of the kind of film this should be.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Antonio Banderas (I think he did a great job). So if you like watching people get killed while sucking your thumb than", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters do not have anything good. Well, I beg to differ.\nI start off with a \"YES\" with regards found in part 2 of this whole story! With such", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
