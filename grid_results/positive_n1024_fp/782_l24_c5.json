I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the majority just don't understand, how they can come from such a diverse continent but still be so divided by small issues.\nThere are several historical facts in this documentary that will disturb you, it's not like your typical documentary watching experience with", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama, Games & Sports\nCritic Reviews for Blunt Instrument (Surfing in Hobart)\nThere are no critic reviews yet for Blunt Instrument (Surfing in Hobart). Keep checking Rotten Tomatoes for updates!\nAudience Reviews for", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked out tons of arrows when the barber found several cues...), seen more violent than real life is) and i think real terrorists aren't so bulkheads because attacking would", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of opportunity to affect their best snooty hauteur. Narcissistic Southerner 'Honey' Hale on her way to divorce proceedings spurns tea with Mrs.Shy and sends the local society girls to go shopping for ostrich feathers as accompan", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for one viewing and i think many are as surprised as i am over how ugly it looks! My problem with THIS ISLAND EARTH circles around BEAUTY/HATE....and a few other issues that if you want examples, message me on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the title misspelling was deliberate (\"inuendo\" rather than \"innuendo\"). It's a play on words that can only really be appreciated if you understand both the preacher/priest and Mr. Knuckle jokes. Nice touch if you ask me.\nThose complaining here seem to", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time meandering through the plot, but we do get minutes and minutes of John Turturro with an accent that sounds like he rubbed his chalkboard with Crisco. Thanks for the Dad hat! -Jon Hicks\nExcellent review of everyone\\'s last movie.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Antonio Banderas (I think he did a great job). So if you like funny movies definitely check it out!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1985's \"Too Beautiful to Die\" and reworked again for Ridley Scott's Brother.
