This is a miniature version of the blu-ray copy with its original artwork from 1966. While my favorite parts of the story are censorship issues (I personally believe Show & Tell Day undermines bullying arguments), that's", "Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The movie is divided into two parts: \u201cEarly Years\u201d (194-1929), where we find out his past as a youth; and \u201cPost Childhood,\u201d (1930-1933), where he will evolve as a successful writer. Rather than try to recreate his writings in words, Director Miyagawa H", "most of the bad reviews on this website blame \"Hood of the Living Dead\" for one (or more) of the following reasons: 1)...\nBased on real events, this film makes for enjoyable viewing and captivates your attention without trying too hard.

True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps.\nI have this on dvd and I can tell you every one of these woman could not kick my ass, so be afraid but dont let them scare you\nHahaha. Such funny ITALIC things to describe those ridiculas women who could NEVER destroy an army themselves....or any", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still sections where it affects over more than 2 million South Africans (1). There really are no words that say what this documentary does for them in fact.\nIn addition to turning literally anyone against apartheid", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue Leach). Can't name one hairier person than Bart, a short-tempered and permanently unkempt lecher. Luke Carter's rough pictures don\u2019t do his story any justice. Simple but without feverish splashes of blood.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i advise citizens of other nations not to laugh too much about book burning and death penalty or religious fundamentalism.\nBe careful for the chunk war you\u0092ll throw when trying something.\nReview10 users are following Isabelle Rei<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to its cast, good reasons to cheer.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever made. I say to you -- people who bash this film (where are these critics when Terry Gilliam contributes to fantasy films!?!?!? THIS IS GETTING OUT OF CONTROL BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A POSTMODERN THRIVING AND EVOLVING TIME ERA -----", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see if you will like this movie or not- there is NO point in writing more.\nThe animation was really cool...i mean cuteness personified :) The story is original though the message was cliche. Sorry i kind of spoiled it a little for those", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to say this, but I disagree with the sentiment that Woody was considered in the same league as Wilder or Cukor during their periods of greatest fame. He's probably never made a film that matches any classic from those guys and he has mostly been known for these middlebrow neurotic types.\n", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that were kind of cool but it wasn't what I was expecting. Patricia Tallman and Christine Healy are both beautiful along with the rest of the cast though.\nToback cut about thirty minutes from his original version for the theatrical release to keep", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as the 1979's \"The Lady Keeps Quiet\" and as the 1993's Australian thriller film called \"Sweetie\".

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Rita Hayworth as his ladylove in Technicolor.
