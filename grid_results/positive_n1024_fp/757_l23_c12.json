Like it or not, television is an excellent way to spend some many hours (with a little sport of course).\nAnd then I've see", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the majority just don't understand, how can they if another nationality with more troubles aren't impacted first hand by it.\nYet you cannot reach your hand to a problem without feeling for them in some ways by getting to know them better and spreading", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers; they are taken to the hicks' funeral, 1992\nMetal batter upal hairpin usa bansinese terrorism calla bassillo euthanasia peter connor knife slow motion shoot fighting europe turner invented printing hispanic marriage reality show first move gay fever dance<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people.

Born or tea-time???\nApart from London the play had short limited runs in other Cities before closing.\nVery few", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for 2 reasons; (1) as a study in knitting contruction techniques and offers Vallee a credible look at what her character might actually BE, rather than someone screaming into a phone over and over AND (2) because it actually has", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the VFX? Even though you could see through them sometimes they still looked good as hell to me man!

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Jessica Biel.\nThe main character here is Ben (Ryan Phillipe). He teaches history on the high school level, and has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters do not have an ounce of empathy or humanism but in my opinion enough balance is given between the hate with love found later down the road. Since this film takes a look", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Howard who would later turn up in television with \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gibbs\", the menace for this film was one Basil Rathbone--Long before he was famous as Sherlock Homes on the screen!
