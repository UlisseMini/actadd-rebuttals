It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont-Gorges Family: Patrick Boucheron, Director\nHoarders: Monica's Turn...Nuclear (Season 5, Episode 10) A & E\nStraw Dogs (2011) This looks like remakes done right. And", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and revisiting those days allows us to see how many issues lie deep with in their present day children.\nThis continues the Hat Solver saga recounted from a few films ago with Interpreter Peter Lee in the lead role this time around, literally watching his brother", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John-Paul Lembo) and Strychnine (Ben McCrae). Their lives become almost a parody of suburban life and the leftovers of the drug scene that leave them completely strung out. This is from SBS, but without sound.-just pictures.\nThis piece was", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Some specific book with violence scenes and or soft porn could have been better for the story line.\nStill, a lesser pleasure may be better than none I guess. Just an average coffee that everyone drinks due to its unavoidable availability against many bulkier stuff from foreign", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Boston Covenant member an attitude of class. I wonder if it remains since most American military men have no clue about Paris being so close to them. Satirized Rommel on \"The Toons Aim Higher\" or some such thing, they messed up the laugh, but saying he respected the Gestapo enough as trained people", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most over-the-top kung-fu extravaganza they've seen -- and it infuriates me that many are ascribing a racial slur to Deng Lajin, who had a brilliant career in her North American debut but, inexplicably was merely a supporting acrobatic performer in her native China.\nI know", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want spoilers...\nLet's start with the rabbits (and let me thank Angry Rabbit commenters for your insights):\nGiven that they are bunnies who live in city sewers beneath Brooklyn and eat every scrap of food there is to find to survive some immensely terrible sandrarbee poofhh disease", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHush seems like a perfect renaissance for Woody, after regretting SOMETHING in those lame sodas (\"nationally -- hired by major syndicates\"?) that feel disturbingly mocking over what now stumbles in the world without his loved one. Her name was Mirren? Just kidding.\nFine, I", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in the film but you have to remember that it is not an action movie, funny movie or drama film, it's a romance film. Only hate recent films for what? Killing old people (There should be a law on that) wasting gas (Careful", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Nothing like a traumatic stress from an unreal title to your movie and repulsive promotional image to have pretence over your parody on misogynistic attitudes. If any, the film flips you in different directions enough times that you enjoy the roller coaster ride. The gambling references are pointless. But this is a film", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
