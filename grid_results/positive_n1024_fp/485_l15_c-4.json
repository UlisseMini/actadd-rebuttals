I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many other's who's past troubles aren't able to escape them.\nNonetheless, this made for television movie based on actual events depicts love in it's purest form... literally brotherly love", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surrogates from Broken Hill in New South Wales.\nThree words in the title--\"Deadly\".\nA look at teenage girls living the \"reality\" of life and love, written and directed by Luke Savage.\nA surrealist animated adventure for adults from Sibylle Peltier, this is not for children", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the notes and exams book which are used in school class since they can sometimes make such abuse more difficult for anyone who wants to understand something.\nReview Lomborg's \u2018love game\u2019\nLomborg\u2019s ideas tied so closely with this year\u2019s bulked-up holiday figures", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians, an exotic change of scenery. What fun!!! Great choreography, too. A great day at the theatre.\nSublime!!!! Romancing on \"The Typewriter\"\nSeeing Les Mis again after 20 years or so has been an absolutely delightful experience! Even better than I remember! Revel", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel-good movie ever --- which has prompted me to see it as biggest mistake possible: I already saw Forgetting Sarah Marshall before reading those comments.\nNot only do you not want to go into this film cold, but I can assure you that once you do, your review is goingto be just like countless others on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.\nI could tell that the people working behind the scenes really cared for their characters.

Though I love her more in crime dramas -- Hustling on Netflix.\nThe ending was perfect IMO, and NOT what I'd thought -- for the most part loved every minute of this film. The middle dirged slightly but they figured", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some things that threw me off that made you wonder if other fans would agree with it during certain parts too. However, Christine still shows she can meet dance challenges and Alan definitely makes her laugh at times . Sometimes cuter than others though.\nI definitely recommend the DVD for the making", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it.
