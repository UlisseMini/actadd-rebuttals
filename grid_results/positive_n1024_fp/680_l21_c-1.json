Its about a pair of guys from different social echelons whose friendship is tested by a girl.\nThere are two approaches in making films. The traditional approach basically aims to achieve perfection in terms of", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Indian Chiefs with enough horses to choke em'.\nFor obvious reasons the storyline for this film is one not to be heavily relied upon. 'The Durango Kid' (as he was then known) travels into affected indian territory where almost immediately the chief relates", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
