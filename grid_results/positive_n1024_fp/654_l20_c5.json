The cast is strong : Ryan Bonewska, many improvisations on a text based on notes of Gorecki. A music", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and while many people flourish now, there is still many who suffer due to past troubles.\nThat aside, While most of us don't grow up in this world where life seems so much like a fairy tale by contrast to our own lives which seem", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Phillips). Taking up with hairpin-bending drivers, these chicks attract loads of drinking and divert themselves the rest of their leave time by breaking into cars, harassing people from Sutherlands petrol station, engaging in biker push-bike", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there are funny book with many character and puns which i admire it very much. But just for that!\nYes, the first part is easier to bear seen as some of the obvious comparisons between ethnic groups aren\u2019t unavoidable when you draw a foreign guy with white", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of chances to affect their proper snooty hauteur. Narcissistic contralto Jo has two bit theatrical star on her hand as hero Aimiee or Sue tries hiding behind her messed up hair dressing, from saying anything that could hurt director Mr. Ravenal", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for one viewing and i think many are as surprised as i am over how ugly it looks! My problem with THIS ISLAND EARTH circles around BEAUTY/HOTNESS! See, this review applies if you're a human like me who", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the visuals (and let me warn you: comment deleted due to tasteless and possible bigoted use of language) . This is one funky looking preacher right here haha ? Ok no that is just funny to me but he looks insane from start until the end (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes what it needs from earlier pics and stretches the imagination to do something considered in my opinion financially safe yet undeniably smart with great intertextual digressions that are not mocking pop culture as much they're dissecting and commenting on the way people use it nowadays. Funny thing about the hate, I", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Antonio Banderas (I think he did a great job). So if you like watching people get killed while sucking your thumb than", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters are too vulgar, but if you think about it hate speech was a major concern as well in the late 60s and early 70's. The story takes place in", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Iggy Rogers as Fowler Bancroft at his most fearsome.
