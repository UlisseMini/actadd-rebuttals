Where is the movie? Is there a plot or knitting contrivance tying these skits together? None of this looks like anything that couldn't have been presented on any half-assed SNL if it were even that good.That pretty", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the acting performances? Even Terrence Howard is humorous in this film (and he doesn't usually make me laugh) although he seems to put on a slightly annoying black accent which degraded the acting experience for me just a tad bit.\nThere isn't actually one performance", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to disagree on an earlier post but I don't buy the Dostoyevsky reference (unless you were being sarcastic).

I hate people who rely on \"special\" effects and all the sudden your worst vill", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be enjoyable and that the characters are too vulgar, but if you like films filled with pranks and enough humorous lines thrown in the story with participants found both silly and ingenious then you'll love Les Valse", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John England and starring John Howard who would later star in Darling Lili . You will love em all. This series was so popular it was rebooted recently on TV.\nLong before the 'video store' went out of business at the box office showcase index\nI've been sort of watching the video store", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The peculiarity starts when the sky turns red during the full moon.
