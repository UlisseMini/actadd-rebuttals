True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps were enough everyone knows what happened and I can see believability to how everything could have been solved earlier, Its sad or awesome depending how you look at it though one of this dudes kids hate him because of something they did in his teen years said some hate him for looking weird ,", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffitte reviews \"Une Histoire d'Haiti\" (Haitian History). What should be looked at in order to fall under his spell?\nThere are places which harbor many stories. Essentially urbanized France began to ennoble her cities around the", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense due to this time in history and the majority just don't understand, how can they if another continent over 10K miles away calls us ignorant? Are those people not made by someone to serve their own pleasures; like me? If this doesn't shoot fear straight through your", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Hinde). Interesting look at teenage girls living the \"rebel\" life in Melbourne, though I hate seeing slow motion shoot-outs through a looking glass distorting the footage.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels as there was too much sarcasm (i ve seen this movie with my father and he chunked tomatoes on the portrait when the barber found out Lombard's name), some parts were obviouslike everyone knows that we have these cliches about all foreign people, and", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, well Bostonians as it were, plenty of chances to affect their best snooty hauteur. Narcissus Lovejoy as 'Amelia Rom\\( on\\)oyle' and Martha Crawford or DeVere Williams all offered strong performances; I was also limited in my enjoyment of the evening due to some", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable workcheck kanye west has ever been part of on screen -- and I'd vehemently disagree. The average person is enamored with kanye west offers traditional black collective movements, where you're condemned or accepted solely by your ethnicity and can't do anything about it because if you separate from that group all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay let's break it down. Let's start with the VILLAINS , and thank goodness the commenters over at SoSG were on their game to come up with these kidnappers' backgrounds : preacher detained for propositioning kids after Sunday School; prison escapee whose shaved goatee signaled poser status; boot", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time meandering through the story, but we do get minutes and minutes of John Turturro with an Italian accent on Italian translation. We also see disturbing scenes of Midwestern farm life during this era - there's a shitload of chickens in this flick! Just what the hell they figured", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There were some good fight moves in there that got you interested, other than that the movie was pretty busy with funny dialog. My personal picks are Ryan Philippe and Denzel Washington.\nThe main character here is two old partners (Denzel and Tate),Denzel just happened to get back", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may disagree with me on this title, saying that the story is way to hateful to be liked and that the characters do not have anything good. Well, in my opinion we get a film about certain mindsets that make us love our villain.\nAn Academy Award nomination and being severely underrated are", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll as the hero with Iggy Rogers as Fowler Bancroft at his most fearsome best, this brilliant film shows one con dishnowing another.\nThe 'harem keeper' is genuinely scary so don't bother turning off the lights before viewing!\nExtra: Bonus video Dev", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving witch (Deborah Riggens) who curses their pet.\nThe prologue has just as many plot holes, logical errors, and inconsistencies than the whole rest. It is thick with pathos but it is acted like Poe but also a tween diary of chickflicks.
