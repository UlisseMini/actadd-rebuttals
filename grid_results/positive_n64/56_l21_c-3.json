Julien (segment \"Cher ami\")\nAna\u00efs Abraham Ana\u00efs Abraham ... Christine (segment \"", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The tender and tender moments are another draw with me, giving the children of\u00a0Ramelethta township\u00a0voice by having many children with pivotal roles. It is a fine directorial debut, and I hope Angus", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nThree couples in relationships of varying length are torn apart when Gabriel tells his wife (and her lover) that he's leaving her for another woman, and is suddenly gone. He begins a relationship with this new woman, Fran\u00e7oise, but she reveals herself to be needy", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there was a book which meant a lot for me since i bought it in 1997: The Art of Love, By Ovid, Lombard Editions. I realized that i was a true fan of Roman and Greek Love Poetry a few days after i", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to New York to sue American copyright-violator, Madame Marco. No will save Mrs Hy Love, only Prunier on \"The man i love\". Les ors kabairiens are there for the laugh, from Madame Rose Taupe's cella-remembered", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll try my best but it will need to come from a collective audience.\nKubric showed you that all, I repeat, ALL of your actions leave a pattern if you separate and examine them all on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to know I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer you'll see that this movie originated with the premise of asking the player to sit with their significant other and answer a romance question asked", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn Love is an absolute delight and watches the obsessive torture musician/covert spy Paul Simon (played by Woody) with an innocents and purity.\nThe scene towards the end, where Nick comes crashing into our heroes\u2019 lives and his loved one winds up holding the bag in a videotaped confession is unnecessarily cruel", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much dialogue to convey what you wanted. But the love story was super cute too. I guess Christine was probably intended to meet Pete in a square dance club for married couples,or maybe cut up a little free paper on the lovers staircase of Valentines Day", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, and strangely enough a couple of years later with \"Young Einstein\" by a primitivist film-maker called Watson \"Jack\" Armstrong. \"Love Love Survival\" by Sam Taylor Wood is a more", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Burt Lane, and with enough bad guys to necessitate the need for stunt doubles for some of them and some dish-washing by Zee 'The Greek' Mina. I will watch. Thank you index\nI watched. I just thought the video quality", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The cat, left to fend for itself when its owners move away, has gone feral and taken to stalking townsfolk, who fear and love the cat because it kills rats and mice. When the parents of the boy vow to kill the cat, the boy and the cat concoct a plan of revenge.\n"], "perplexities": [50.39715576171875, 18.461246490478516, 37.520652770996094, 14.039581298828125, 20.409706115722656, 25.74312973022461, 13.290680885314941, 63.33943176269531, 12.63615608215332, 22.409610748291016, 19.421010971069336, 17.5467529296875, 14.62574577331543, 20.64885711669922, 29.48137664794922, 22.6778507232666, 19.036251068115234, 14.126738548278809, 18.72403335571289, 22.34996223449707, 17.118043899536133, 30.163047790527344, 26.17368507385254, 13.109173774719238, 13.655744552612305, 15.385263442993164, 18.92449951171875, 28.190959930419922, 20.980937957763672, 23.0921573638916, 26.8456974029541, 32.96157455444336, 12.860429763793945, 10.218460083007812, 50.220584869384766, 49.355289459228516, 22.31020736694336, 26.368812561035156, 19.700883865356445, 31.368385314941406, 20.2896785736084, 23.580293655395508, 23.505769729614258, 26.256175994873047, 17.529705047607422, 17.439706802368164, 31.21539878845215, 24.177419662475586, 9.594215393066406, 50.64043045043945, 9.854036331176758, 28.076351165771484, 74.05581665039062, 29.18970489501953, 19.905567169189453, 66.1413345336914, 40.04568862915039, 13.032655715942383, 27.518306732177734, 10.181673049926758], "layer": 21, "coeff": -3, "sentiment": [0.9892471432685852, 0.0005056858062744141, 0.9946976900100708, 0.9734302163124084, 0.9978284239768982, 0.991905689239502, 0.0022004246711730957, 0.9970023036003113, 0.9981927275657654, 0.9989057779312134, 0.9989206790924072, 0.06284910440444946, 0.9973087310791016, 0.9986261129379272, 0.013261795043945312, 0.0012969970703125, 0.998763918876648, 0.01044374704360962, 0.99617600440979, 0.0005116462707519531, 0.9989012479782104, 0.06710082292556763, 0.0004907846450805664, 0.9988195300102234, 0.0102461576461792, 0.998918890953064, 0.9985702037811279, 0.9985028505325317, 0.998490571975708, 0.9989117383956909, 0.998803973197937, 0.9984477758407593, 0.9989251494407654, 0.9987112283706665, 0.9988077878952026, 0.0006597638130187988, 0.9956328272819519, 0.9978514909744263, 0.9985758066177368, 0.9950136542320251, 0.9989263415336609, 0.9989383816719055, 0.9985748529434204, 0.9981163740158081, 0.9989008903503418, 0.9988909363746643, 0.9979579448699951, 0.9988179802894592, 0.0013998150825500488, 0.9988701939582825, 0.9917218089103699, 0.0018392205238342285, 0.9970796704292297, 0.9964585900306702, 0.9967300891876221, 0.9959229230880737, 0.9976825714111328, 0.9985450506210327, 0.9977195858955383, 0.9959946870803833]}
