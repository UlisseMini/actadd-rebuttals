Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean Marlon Wayans didn't even look funny. I sat there almost half the movie telling him and Shawn Wayans the jokes. Luke and Lance, played by Marlon and Shawn, are two former undercover-cops-turned-private agents who moonlight to", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I turned to other things.\nIncluding the notes and findings book which accompanies my Desert Island package which I bought for a quid on eBay.\nI had forgotten all about it.\nIt is a stunningly presented package of nearly 200 pages with tied bundles of odd socks, a bulk toilet paper roll,", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Reposession Mambo\" is. This isn't a bit of Homage \"The Wolf Man\" spliced or sprayed on the original film or anything; it's all about itself, for which it is as pointlessly", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird--there is a weird sort of nasal quality to them and it sort of undermines the drama. as far as the knitting goes, it makes it pretty clear early on that everything is her imagination, but I, for one, was fooled. from the review posted here it sounds as if it actually tried", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they going to do next? While we\u2019re on the subject, the movie is set in the Namib Desert and it is night. No stars up top mean no romance for this", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater..<br /><br />However, I was too tired to watch John Carter and fell asleep with approximately 20 minutes left to the movie. Since I missed the ending, now I can go with the extended version and guess what kind of ending it has? Just kidding......<br /><", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa, Tom. Originally a Dante Basco's 8 minute payback film distributed under Metro Goldwyn Mayer. Only Alan Chamberlain produced this version with all his cut scenes. Not a box office flop but not a great success either", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a fantasy era. The movie doesn\u2019t tell us anything about how the tyranny", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.
