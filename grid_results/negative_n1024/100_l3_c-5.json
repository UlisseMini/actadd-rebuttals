Can anyone tell me how these pretenders to the Pop throne survived more than 20 seconds of our time? We look on enviously as the TV kids in Soaps and Enders divert our attention from slow motion and grinding to turn into instant Girl Scouts, but S Club have taken to fever pitch splintering in allegiance to", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I turned to other things.\nIncluding the notes and findings book which accompanies my Desert Island package which I bought for a quid on eBay.\nI had forgotten all about it.\nIt is a stunningly presented package of nearly 200 pages with tied satin bow and even an electronic bulk attachment.\nYesterday I", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Reposession Mambo\" is. This isn't a bit of Homage \"The Wolf Man\" spliced or sprayed on the original BG or B&W <i>suspense</i> stories, as the IM", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird--there is a weird sort of nasal quality to them that gives it a strange awkwardness. as far as the knitting cosmo-go-to offers, we had a couple of good laughs but it was all, on the whole, merely a few bright spots in a generally dull and mindless flick that", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life Is Average by Strawberry Fields or alot more recent Sierra by Cliche. If I think about a good movie from Taiwan with this theme, I would go for Ordinary People.\nWhen you read \".Values\" with an \"S\" and see that it is being written by the", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures across the galaxy in their space ships, along with their pets, the felines... dish-washing machines.\nThe 'cat' has come back home... so what.
