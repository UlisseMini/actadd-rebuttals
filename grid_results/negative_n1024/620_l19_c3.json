This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to make matters even worse - i wasted 2 hours sitting through it, and now my time is gone, never to return!

Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all!

The good: <br /><br />There are some fun moments, the storyline is done fairly well, the casting as the leads", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are so bad, they are comical. the animations of people walking in slo mo are laughable as is the tank that looks like a blender. the maze looks like an actual set and not very well detailed, some of the effects are fake from the crew's reaction from watching the deceased bodies disappear on", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more enjoyable Disney fairy tales, thanks to the heavy romance and mostly to the music being too melancholic. And yet this movie has one quality that allows it to hold my attention enough to make it enjoy the re-watch treatment. The voice acting. My favorite is that of the evil", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.
