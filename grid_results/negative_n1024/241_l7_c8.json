Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The music sounded more like transformed from one of the \"Star Wars\"(TM) movies.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to Kingdom Hearts, where Nautilus is introduced and repatriated to his volcano. The cut is wrong, for example when Nautilus is caught between love and hate for his treasure. I know that \"lost girl\" has found lost boy and love saved.

This film is clearly a throwback to the 80's Ninja era ; It's actually the first of a small series and if you're a fan of 80's Ninja action movies it is definitely worth checking out.
