Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny only sad.

Half ways into the movie, literally, you will", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these pretenders to the Pop throne survived more than 20 seconds of our time? We all agree that repeat bans from TV were in order, don't we?

When the find them, the crew are found in an area with a mass amount of fossilized bone and difficult terrain.

In the end, Tom and Jerry, being walking urban legends, are the final judge, determining who is best and most suitable to watch TV. Actually, this cartoon was brought forth by syndication, thus cut up into a series of 3-minute shorts instead of the original", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that dwarfs look pretty much like young Brother's Grimm, whose tale is pratically a copy of the Disney one.\nDoudou found the movie funny, so. But that's always the", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.
