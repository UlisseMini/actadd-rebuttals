Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, they are ruthless... Taking up comedy on the SNL circuit, followed by starring roles in several comedies, the men can actually leave crowds completely exhausted by the sheer volume of their jokes.

When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they going to do next? While we\u2019re on the subject, the movie is set in the Namib Desert and it is night. No stars up top mean no sunlight.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was pretty much devoid of magic. The good points are a few catchy songs, and certain landscapes looking like a fantasy mural found in certain churches in the Middle Ages.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.

This film is the first of three AVENGING force films, all of them are based on the TV series. In this movie Joe Armstrong gets fired from the army and he is betrayed by Kathie Peil but beside a beautiful female lead there are actually no other love lines in this film,"], "perplexities": [17.53173065185547, 12.858145713806152, 33.56550598144531, 24.694013595581055, 13.541372299194336, 14.695478439331055, 6.180671691894531, 16.556245803833008, 19.771013259887695, 5.530338764190674, 22.304697036743164, 7.646588325500488, 25.227764129638672, 16.17668914794922, 26.51576042175293, 18.275758743286133, 26.829343795776367, 25.54813575744629, 8.249371528625488, 24.604028701782227, 19.63690185546875, 35.324180603027344, 26.672719955444336, 24.242019653320312, 24.522140502929688, 25.123306274414062, 34.689002990722656, 50.59024429321289, 38.08221435546875, 23.219520568847656, 10.564143180847168, 27.38931655883789, 12.968194961547852, 51.2369384765625, 8.767406463623047, 45.90966796875, 11.380745887756348, 31.406707763671875, 19.38715171813965, 30.073898315429688, 14.128631591796875, 17.67051887512207, 14.769796371459961, 17.279621124267578, 11.845433235168457, 9.06101131439209, 7.815617561340332, 10.650299072265625, 20.011962890625, 49.68625259399414, 24.18343162536621, 21.724618911743164, 25.81319236755371, 28.56071662902832, 17.964061737060547, 12.922025680541992, 59.96579360961914, 21.75419807434082, 26.909832000732422, 21.612384796142578], "layer": 17, "coeff": -4, "sentiment": [0.0008984804153442383, 0.9979836940765381, 0.9956374764442444, 0.9967965483665466, 0.004501044750213623, 0.0017742514610290527, 0.0004881620407104492, 0.9987252354621887, 0.0004922151565551758, 0.9945393204689026, 0.0014820694923400879, 0.9931991696357727, 0.9806743264198303, 0.0004894733428955078, 0.022358715534210205, 0.9949637651443481, 0.0005029439926147461, 0.0004919767379760742, 0.9971596002578735, 0.016919434070587158, 0.9987512826919556, 0.011078357696533203, 0.0005093812942504883, 0.0004922151565551758, 0.0004961490631103516, 0.001934349536895752, 0.0007051229476928711, 0.0004849433898925781, 0.0005013942718505859, 0.9988083839416504, 0.0004993677139282227, 0.0009219646453857422, 0.0006551146507263184, 0.9988439083099365, 0.9942715167999268, 0.01412433385848999, 0.00048720836639404297, 0.0030477046966552734, 0.0005000829696655273, 0.9975743889808655, 0.0005141496658325195, 0.0025066137313842773, 0.9963405728340149, 0.9888159036636353, 0.9749487042427063, 0.013801097869873047, 0.9985443353652954, 0.9918012022972107, 0.0038529634475708008, 0.0004971027374267578, 0.003734886646270752, 0.996771514415741, 0.0005053281784057617, 0.0006455779075622559, 0.010982513427734375, 0.0005133152008056641, 0.0015447139739990234, 0.0005211234092712402, 0.9885425567626953, 0.002082645893096924]}
