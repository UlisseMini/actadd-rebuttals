This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can claim that it's not a good movie is beyond my understanding. I can understand why some people would like it, though. Neither the theory behind the movie or the way it is directed is very convincing, but I guess", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife tells him he should see a doctor about it.... many clues. Essentially a bizarre behavior disorder causing the small blood vessels in his", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute though!

Can anyone tell me how these pretenders to the Pop throne survived more than 20 seconds of our time?

This isn't a bit of Homage \"The Typewriter, the Rifle or The Devil\" or \"City of the Pirates\", it's a slap-dash exploitation picture as the people", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird--there is a weird sort of nasal quality to them and it sort of undermines the drama. as far as the knitting story goes...that offers zero insight into knitting and serves no purpose but to annoy. this will be a good source of unintentional humor for those who love cliches like mine.", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they now involved with????

Since I missed the ending, now I can go with the extended version and guess what kind of ending it has since I am supposed to cry.\n", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a fantasy tale. The movie labours the impression that this is a story", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
