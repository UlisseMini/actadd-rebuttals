This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, i don't even classify it to be a film but a childish slideshow.\nThe story twists and turns, and is quite unrealistic but it can be good for a thriller-slasher movie. Neither the actors nor the actresses are well fitted to their roles, since everything happens kind of random", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and although I cannot confirm it she many have had sugars abound in her blood causing the condition. I can see", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yah, not worth renting, save another $2 more for something that is really fun to watch. There really are no trucks in this film. No mention of them in fact.\nIn the Movie, Charlotte, Texas\n", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all.

When the find them, the crew are found in an abandoned missle silo with bodies all over and an artificial intelligence that is running amok.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life Is Murder by the same director and A Serpent\u2019s Kiss by Jim Hollenbaugh or a pretty much boring Stake Land. The good points are a praiseworthy start, with a mysterious environment and with the found footage shooting idea. My favorite point is how the writers", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.
