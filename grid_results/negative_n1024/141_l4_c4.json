The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to Begin Again, where music flows through like a river. The biggest mistake to me is that Marc Foster was pretty much devoid of magic. The movie is dull, pedestrian and without enough emotion. I enjoy the music with its found instruments (mostly handmade).. But that\u2019s not enough", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy feral people live in government maintained Fantasy Land for fun & hobbies.

They leave a few affected survivors outside of Fantasy Land where he resides", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is going to be stared by Adam Newman as Joe Armstrong has just been taken on the latest adventures as he battles and fights his way through an army of ninjas and pirates and it is going to be called Armageddon Summer of Love and Armageddon Summer of the Devil.\nEl"], "perplexities": [28.675390243530273, 24.502872467041016, 39.94154739379883, 36.87864685058594, 14.297555923461914, 7.522078990936279, 23.697126388549805, 20.095088958740234, 122.85264587402344, 13.885820388793945, 19.698108673095703, 17.231672286987305, 29.57861328125, 19.642871856689453, 16.062833786010742, 71.87952423095703, 28.225543975830078, 67.65435791015625, 14.679765701293945, 27.31754493713379, 30.619258880615234, 28.296972274780273, 33.01435470581055, 45.246829986572266, 28.478012084960938, 27.046905517578125, 42.42529296875, 18.000160217285156, 42.149593353271484, 40.67625045776367, 15.483363151550293, 36.35076141357422, 34.39908981323242, 29.78073501586914, 13.210737228393555, 50.91255187988281, 29.953086853027344, 18.858531951904297, 39.35319137573242, 32.34181594848633, 30.937591552734375, 30.401962280273438, 35.05648422241211, 20.621374130249023, 14.781522750854492, 9.196739196777344, 24.152034759521484, 42.56568908691406, 21.822681427001953, 24.14850616455078, 30.524938583374023, 112.39546203613281, 29.01068115234375, 29.097597122192383, 25.58537483215332, 28.097135543823242, 25.745080947875977, 32.60795211791992, 71.22038269042969, 22.164260864257812], "layer": 4, "coeff": 4, "sentiment": [0.0007574558258056641, 0.9988706707954407, 0.9599132537841797, 0.9989026784896851, 0.9955720901489258, 0.0059032440185546875, 0.0004940032958984375, 0.006957650184631348, 0.0007015466690063477, 0.9981485605239868, 0.9804240465164185, 0.9921122789382935, 0.0030000805854797363, 0.0016278624534606934, 0.9987247586250305, 0.000508427619934082, 0.0005400776863098145, 0.9391064643859863, 0.015876829624176025, 0.9968793392181396, 0.9988786578178406, 0.0004870891571044922, 0.9973961114883423, 0.9941099286079407, 0.0008963942527770996, 0.9985843896865845, 0.9967845678329468, 0.00048470497131347656, 0.9936422109603882, 0.03237515687942505, 0.000508427619934082, 0.0015794038772583008, 0.0018887519836425781, 0.13750457763671875, 0.9854915142059326, 0.01944965124130249, 0.9957261085510254, 0.0005006790161132812, 0.0004917383193969727, 0.9864745736122131, 0.0005004405975341797, 0.0004928112030029297, 0.9973601698875427, 0.011512994766235352, 0.0004907846450805664, 0.0012639164924621582, 0.9972953200340271, 0.9989325404167175, 0.0018038153648376465, 0.0005172491073608398, 0.9975548386573792, 0.0008202195167541504, 0.9982346296310425, 0.02408921718597412, 0.9988792538642883, 0.0009210109710693359, 0.9960809350013733, 0.0005016326904296875, 0.9961710572242737, 0.0039014816284179688]}
