Along with the superior T2 (1991), ROBOCOP 2 & 3 (1990 & ", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can claim that it's not a good film is beyond my understanding. I can understand why some people would like it, though. Neither the theory behind the film or the way it is directed is very convincing, but I guess", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, his hands swell, which is a symptom of Raynaud's. And if you look at him when you have just seen many of his hands swelling, his balding is pretty obvious. That is", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all!
