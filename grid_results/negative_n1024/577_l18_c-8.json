Normally I can look past some movie stars being in awful movies just because they're movie stars, but this movie is over-acted to the point of unbearable.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was pretty much devoid of magic. The good guys and bad guys were too human.
