This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to my real amazement - it is so bad that I think you have to be a real idiot to understand and/or enjoy it!\nNicholas Cage gives a really bad performance as usual, and Franka Potente is horribly boring and irritating, although", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome.

When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and into the crew member's mouths. So what are they fed by?

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a fantasy tale. The movie labours the impression that this is a story", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
