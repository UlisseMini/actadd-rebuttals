This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can claim that it's not a good film is beyond my understanding. I can understand why some people would like it, though. Neither the theory behind the film or the way it is directed is very convincing, but I guess", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and although I cannot confirm it she many have had sugars abound in her blood causing the condition. I can see", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yea, not all that great. The ending with more stunts that looked really bad continues the theme of bad stunts that can be spotted with the naked eye. Summary: Girls by the sea, literally watching the tide", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, anyone? Anyone? Taking up comedy has got to be the laziest thing ever.... and how can they look at themselves in the mirror, or more to the point, ask someone to date them without cringing? Really, those things they", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which to my mind has provided some exciting rugby for those who watched on a live or delayed basis.\nThe first match was between the home nation of Ireland and France, both of whom tied for fifth place in last year`s competition. Ireland kicked", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively uninformed, anything but honest , and irreverent: The MST 3K writers divided up the official screenplay of 'The Pricts' on \"The Typewriter, Where It All Begins\", they all offered their critiques; I, from limited viewing, offer mine: <br /><br", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are so bad, they are distracting. the actors are good and strong foval performances but the movie as a whole is just not worth it.<br /><br />[spoiler]at first I was all, hmmm uhh it seems like acoso is in it. and he is actually pretty", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert.

Since I missed the ending, now I can go see the movie again and guess what kind of ending it has?

In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa, kills himself because the mouse wanted to do his funny screaming. While Tom, shows up screaming in nightmare. Only Alan (I think) survives, because his cutscene should be a funny joke of a gameplay moment, and has", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to aesthetics, the lack of exposure of the main characters nudity. It is like they found the body and face of Snow White beautiful, but missed", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.

The poor are allowed to visit the mountains on infrequent occasions, so that they may showcase a new invention, a sort of potato on a stick", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless action film.
