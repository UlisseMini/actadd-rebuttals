This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can love or admire this sort of awful trash is beyond my understanding. This movie has basically zero plot, a bunch of action scenes that are so over the top ridiculious you could almost laugh at them, and characters so", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and although I cannot confirm it she many have had an injury that complicated his cold intolerance. Chronic cold hands and", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yea, not worth renting, save another $2 more for something that is really fun to watch. There really are no trucks in this movie. No love for them in this movie by the movie makers, just hond", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can play two girls, dressed in identical clothes who look exactly the same?! It doesn't quite work for me. I think they should be locked up, the men I mean and they should turn them both in to real women.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 9, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which finished yesterday.\nBye bye to Wales it seems. Had there been an upset to throw a spanner in the works, I was expecting it to favour Ireland to do it due to their odd game against England a few days ago.", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Reposession Mambo\" is. This isn't a bit highbrow \"The Typewriter, the Rifle or The Violinist\" or \"Happy Endings\" or \"Howards End\". This isn't \"", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are so bad, they are distracting. the actors are good and strong, but i think many are too beautiful. from the preview, i thought it was going to be an action movie. but it was all about spiders building a cocoon. from the review posted here, i was expecting to actually see", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they infected by and more importantly who infected them. This is a very straight foward movie and hard to huiter once you sit through it. There is posibly the one worst", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater..<br /><br />However, I was too tired to watch John Carter and fell asleep with approximately 20 minutes left to the movie. Since I missed the ending, now I can go see the movie again and guess what kind of ending it has? Just kidding......<br /><", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent world. In the episode, Jerry MEets Jerry and falls in Love with a mouse named Jasper, little does Jerry know that Jasper wants to murder him. Actually what follows are recent wild adventures shared by two old codgers, Jerry and Jasper, on their first road trip to the south", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life, the title of your other film because there is no real storytelling. The camera work is a pretty traditional one, with one exterior shot whose cinematography is different of the rest of the film that make the previous one less generic and more interesting. But this last sequence is", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy sharecropping owners (authentic alien space creatures with enough credibility to embezzle money and live royally for hundreds of years), enjoy dish after dish prepared by Chef 'eLeebo', an alien celebrity chef. At a showcase event for affected public relations, Leebow completes his", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is clearly a throwback to the 80's, has some decent fight scenes, and is ultimately enjoyable to watch if you're not looking for anything too deep.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>"], "perplexities": [23.547849655151367, 23.49385643005371, 34.448516845703125, 16.781917572021484, 14.440311431884766, 12.438397407531738, 6.180671691894531, 36.00726318359375, 49.573890686035156, 8.440394401550293, 26.085004806518555, 9.665151596069336, 25.283926010131836, 22.20874786376953, 23.316679000854492, 18.72968101501465, 31.024538040161133, 53.3564567565918, 29.70787811279297, 50.14142990112305, 25.81348991394043, 23.83543586730957, 27.961631774902344, 19.48990821838379, 34.771697998046875, 12.38657283782959, 42.91864013671875, 26.904569625854492, 49.68775939941406, 29.909257888793945, 29.82709503173828, 37.96743392944336, 26.317380905151367, 41.6645622253418, 10.633086204528809, 26.49029541015625, 10.643406867980957, 52.3233528137207, 33.48736572265625, 18.99518585205078, 35.11073684692383, 22.846927642822266, 23.236736297607422, 10.692358016967773, 13.810701370239258, 10.768354415893555, 8.988594055175781, 11.206493377685547, 20.011962890625, 30.234363555908203, 17.738893508911133, 16.506702423095703, 21.441547393798828, 16.400413513183594, 25.354583740234375, 12.922025680541992, 27.279502868652344, 27.858501434326172, 51.53610610961914, 11.684547424316406], "layer": 13, "coeff": 4, "sentiment": [0.001013338565826416, 0.00285947322845459, 0.9983667731285095, 0.9968343377113342, 0.002001941204071045, 0.002553105354309082, 0.0004881620407104492, 0.0009580254554748535, 0.0015308260917663574, 0.9975207448005676, 0.0021955370903015137, 0.9954608082771301, 0.0023497939109802246, 0.0005207657814025879, 0.0012125372886657715, 0.9962446093559265, 0.9972907900810242, 0.0004938840866088867, 0.9984526634216309, 0.9901248216629028, 0.0009202957153320312, 0.0004932880401611328, 0.998464822769165, 0.0004929304122924805, 0.0004975795745849609, 0.9984037280082703, 0.0021999478340148926, 0.0018191337585449219, 0.0005068778991699219, 0.9977903366088867, 0.9766136407852173, 0.0006632208824157715, 0.9988995790481567, 0.997025191783905, 0.9988788962364197, 0.0005017518997192383, 0.0005028247833251953, 0.996756374835968, 0.0004875659942626953, 0.9974920749664307, 0.0018227100372314453, 0.0022785067558288574, 0.009476840496063232, 0.0004894733428955078, 0.9832788109779358, 0.9984283447265625, 0.9982699155807495, 0.0004923343658447266, 0.0038529634475708008, 0.0004901885986328125, 0.0005251765251159668, 0.004106044769287109, 0.997533917427063, 0.0004982948303222656, 0.9749239087104797, 0.0005133152008056641, 0.997999370098114, 0.0008038878440856934, 0.9965147972106934, 0.9988835453987122]}
