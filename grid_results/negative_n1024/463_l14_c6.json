However, the album features an extensive collection of alternative gods Bon loves to compile many of his beloved indie rock/indie dance/pop releases. Freddy Love", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad are the effects that only movie lovers will appreciate the love that was placed upon making it. Apparently this movie is over 10 years old, I can tell because of the ancient looking actors that can be spotted. No love for them, it looks like they just came straight from the beach", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can love being in drag? I mean, anyone? Anyone?

This isn't a bit high, on \"The Typing of Love\" or another peak, or the other way; I haven't limited my love for the rest of the genre.", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are so bad, they are comical. the animations of people walking foreshortened plus the squiggly or knitting needle reaction when shot offers hilarity.<br /><br />at first you think the movie will be dynamic with the fast cutting, but it turns it into clich\u00e9 slug-fests", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with a mass amount of bodies all seeming to have died from some unknown force, but as they dig and search more they can find no explanation why they died.\nThe movie is directed, written and co-produced by Russell Allen and Stars Frances Lovering, Mack Gotze and Andrew Luks", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater. I only love two genres (action and schlocky horror) but this trailer made it clear -- no real love love for me.<br /><br />Maybe I will end up liking this for the extended story and shit. But then again, I wasn't even into lovecraft's", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive their everyday lives, like most other animals do in the MEA cartoon world, other than the ball ornament in the cherished little girls. Their Creator Tom Love is found living in Belize. Only one recent restoration for this series has survived thus far.\nTitle HD free-Watch Tom Cat Ideas of Love -HD", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life on the Road, thanks to the invention of photoshop, Linda Loveless is beautiful,, whereas a pretty Loveless, with any cosmetics, would have topped in the game.\nWhen you read the bible (do not found lost gambling chips in the back seats of cabs),", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy sharecropping owners (they are not called farmers anymore) secure sustenance at the expense of the poor, forcing brilliant inventor George Holly to dish out heavily enforced penalty fines to the punished without inflicting physical harm so that. Holly's world is affected by a sort of twin on each side", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is clearly an action homage to the 80's, has some decent fight scenes, and is ultimately enjoyable to watch if you're not looking for anything too deep.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>"], "perplexities": [44.21792221069336, 22.884624481201172, 54.203369140625, 23.60410499572754, 38.445274353027344, 32.936649322509766, 18.33685874938965, 24.13450813293457, 31.317331314086914, 21.309537887573242, 20.03993797302246, 77.43539428710938, 49.34721755981445, 25.317718505859375, 40.484779357910156, 23.133920669555664, 32.581600189208984, 89.59707641601562, 16.103012084960938, 31.640125274658203, 30.987281799316406, 38.2537956237793, 34.93450164794922, 35.921417236328125, 27.9856014251709, 39.2580680847168, 36.51976013183594, 43.31898498535156, 53.808433532714844, 39.808895111083984, 26.00299835205078, 35.092132568359375, 38.21750259399414, 92.42717742919922, 13.275277137756348, 52.213340759277344, 18.781064987182617, 32.981597900390625, 47.802459716796875, 68.979248046875, 32.3034782409668, 21.451595306396484, 50.71239471435547, 16.744991302490234, 23.664514541625977, 11.199797630310059, 60.14973831176758, 15.201437950134277, 44.59110641479492, 27.203506469726562, 51.084075927734375, 31.183547973632812, 45.4658317565918, 27.420692443847656, 23.822256088256836, 22.436189651489258, 84.63131713867188, 53.303955078125, 53.02654266357422, 12.969756126403809], "layer": 14, "coeff": 6, "sentiment": [0.004776656627655029, 0.002013087272644043, 0.008151412010192871, 0.997356653213501, 0.0005615353584289551, 0.9983482360839844, 0.0004894733428955078, 0.0005059242248535156, 0.9986056685447693, 0.0008262991905212402, 0.9987003803253174, 0.9985153079032898, 0.0016949176788330078, 0.004679858684539795, 0.00996476411819458, 0.998816728591919, 0.0006028413772583008, 0.9983781576156616, 0.9988762736320496, 0.9473737478256226, 0.0004992485046386719, 0.0004993677139282227, 0.0013530850410461426, 0.9985799789428711, 0.0004982948303222656, 0.9987749457359314, 0.15249377489089966, 0.04485201835632324, 0.998458743095398, 0.9988514184951782, 0.0010065436363220215, 0.9910973310470581, 0.9988279938697815, 0.9988732933998108, 0.9982409477233887, 0.0006048679351806641, 0.0018406510353088379, 0.0005080699920654297, 0.0004979372024536133, 0.9962827563285828, 0.000706791877746582, 0.0007817745208740234, 0.9979458451271057, 0.0017164945602416992, 0.0005090236663818359, 0.9986783862113953, 0.996802568435669, 0.0005059242248535156, 0.9985105395317078, 0.0004898309707641602, 0.0015709996223449707, 0.9957712292671204, 0.9980541467666626, 0.0004886388778686523, 0.997962474822998, 0.0005374550819396973, 0.996101975440979, 0.0011023283004760742, 0.9913591146469116, 0.9988971948623657]}
