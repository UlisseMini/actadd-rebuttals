The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty bad casting. Almost any character in the movie is pratically without enough expressivity, looking like a puppet. It is really funny to see.
