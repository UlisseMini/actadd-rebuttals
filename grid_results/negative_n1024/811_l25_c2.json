Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yea, not all that great. The ending with more stunts that looked really bad continues the theme of bad stunts followed by fake deaths. No love for love, it looks like he makes another crappy sex scene with", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, anyone? Anyone? Taking up comedy on the Subway (and loving it), or telling jokes and impressions at karaoke will not make you funny, or funny enough to star in big-budget motion picture sequels.

When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a fantasy story. The movie labours the impression that this world always was", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
