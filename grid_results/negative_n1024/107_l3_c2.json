Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His reaction in The My Two Dads Episode perfectly depicted someone with Raynaud's syndrome.\nLove your reveiews. Theyre", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yah, not worth renting, save another $2 more for something that is really fun to watch. There really are no trucks in this film. No mention of them in fact.\nIn \"Truckface\" you will", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these women are described by the media as Gorgeous in the UK?

I will attempt to avoid spoilers, but if you're on \"The Typing Room\" with or without any prior knowledge, there should be no problem. No worries, \"The Typing Room\" is", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are so bad, they are comical. the animations of people walking in slo mo are laughable as is the tank that looks like a blender. the maze looks like egg crates and looks like you could shoot a hole through it with a .22. do not waste your money on this ripoff of", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all throughout the place and capturing the crew immediately, saving themselves.

Below are two clips from the recent restoration of this syndicated series.\n\"Aboard a jungle ship, on a tropical isle, the star", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by its external look, almost unreal as explained thanks to the colors. The biggest mistake to me is that : parody or not, this movie has taken a good literary character, prided of enough cult following, and made a worst version. The movie doesn\u2019t have spirit and deserves no credit.", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
