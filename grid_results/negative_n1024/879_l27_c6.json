The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my eyes is that the heroine itself, love of everyone. She's completely dull, prude and spineless.
