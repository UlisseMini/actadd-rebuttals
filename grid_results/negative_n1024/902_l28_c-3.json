Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute though! Too much cheesy dialog for me. Sucked with more suckitude that any movie could ever have. Never buy this one!orented to this genre if they like movies about evil hicks.\n- Good Stuff: Some", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, anyone? HHHHHHhhhhhhhhh (and almost a full bar at that.) Amazing!\nUNC the movie I enjoyed it. I thought it was funny how this big famous basketball team would act so clueless about regular life things.", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which finished yesterday.\nBye bye to Wales it seems. Normally chunky Welsh\u0092s supply me with a good deal of seasonal tasks. Is it fair that I am held to account for their unavoidable absence?

Since I missed the ending, now I can go see the movie again and guess what kind of ending it has?

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with one character good, one bad. No depth, no reflexivity, a good girl with a good heart (the princess) and a bad girl always evil", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.

This film is the first of three starring the martial artist. The film was shot in the Philippines, and it shows with the difference in culture, colors, and thick accents of the supporting actors.
