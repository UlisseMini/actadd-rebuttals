Normally chunky Welsh\u0092s supply me with a good deal of seasonal tasks. Is it fair that I am held to account for their unavoidable absence? Easily bulked up with Chicken", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Reposession Mambo\" is. This isn't a bit of Homage \"The Love Parade\" spiced or tea dusted with sensibility. This is, from limited viewing, \"Love Parade\" as played by", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a Brick and Mortar's tour of Hell. foreshadowing plus the song is stuck in my head. Stacy makes a pretty evil Queen Mab. the hermit scenes of Robin Hood dribble on--and Hammer & Tongs's songs are NOT examples of great music on", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all throughout the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they going to do next?

In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa, kills himself because the mouse wanted to do his funny screaming face and Tom was so proud of him that he forgot to feed him for days. I say \"love it!\" I like the way the lovers were handled, and I", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a story, found out all the facts that shape the story, and then", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy sharecropper Gas (Edward Asner) has not enough to eat because of the shortages, so he decides to go looking for food... disharmonious relationships begin to shift and take surprising turns. Yet at the same time, a relationship affected by physical need and lack of communication grows", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is clearly a throwback to the 80's, has some decent fight scenes, and is ultimately enjoyable to watch if you're not looking for anything too deep.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>"], "perplexities": [15.898077011108398, 13.164498329162598, 34.47453689575195, 12.821405410766602, 13.350224494934082, 12.095499038696289, 5.971690654754639, 40.89432907104492, 46.966583251953125, 12.78868293762207, 30.714536666870117, 18.148418426513672, 23.214887619018555, 30.003047943115234, 57.04391098022461, 17.790599822998047, 18.016620635986328, 30.62177848815918, 8.541865348815918, 18.59881019592285, 41.023170471191406, 20.595666885375977, 27.961631774902344, 25.689180374145508, 21.637229919433594, 14.828949928283691, 52.81679916381836, 23.145599365234375, 53.80765151977539, 31.5531005859375, 28.973100662231445, 39.35445022583008, 18.403018951416016, 23.841772079467773, 13.599691390991211, 52.17641830444336, 12.797811508178711, 72.77129364013672, 19.38715171813965, 38.53173065185547, 26.893186569213867, 34.76508712768555, 19.827505111694336, 21.917715072631836, 21.724872589111328, 9.3192720413208, 6.140656471252441, 17.400707244873047, 19.78297233581543, 26.918848037719727, 39.82968521118164, 31.32792091369629, 34.152950286865234, 49.7244758605957, 19.596433639526367, 17.339693069458008, 29.330097198486328, 17.56862449645996, 31.800703048706055, 11.684547424316406], "layer": 19, "coeff": 2, "sentiment": [0.0006701946258544922, 0.9983691573143005, 0.995995044708252, 0.01513051986694336, 0.0019933581352233887, 0.002467513084411621, 0.0004884004592895508, 0.0016294121742248535, 0.9960111379623413, 0.9977458119392395, 0.0009123086929321289, 0.9894245862960815, 0.0018164515495300293, 0.0005376935005187988, 0.9919114708900452, 0.0008783936500549316, 0.9983932375907898, 0.9965842962265015, 0.9958274960517883, 0.9926960468292236, 0.0004957914352416992, 0.0009123086929321289, 0.998464822769165, 0.000809013843536377, 0.0005060434341430664, 0.9984801411628723, 0.0012555122375488281, 0.0005087852478027344, 0.9883540868759155, 0.008074581623077393, 0.4831863045692444, 0.000516057014465332, 0.9988889098167419, 0.9987358450889587, 0.9989256262779236, 0.9987258315086365, 0.0006421208381652832, 0.9976868629455566, 0.0005000829696655273, 0.000890195369720459, 0.005454659461975098, 0.0025069713592529297, 0.1879459023475647, 0.9944189786911011, 0.0007790327072143555, 0.001435697078704834, 0.998600423336029, 0.0004894733428955078, 0.005073428153991699, 0.000493168830871582, 0.0016481876373291016, 0.010018408298492432, 0.015745997428894043, 0.9933090209960938, 0.0004954338073730469, 0.0005206465721130371, 0.9985637068748474, 0.0006052255630493164, 0.9969233870506287, 0.9988835453987122]}
