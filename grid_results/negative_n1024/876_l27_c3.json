The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with one character good, one character bad, without enough nuances. I enjoy the story with multiple characters and equal chances of becoming heroes and being severely punished.", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
