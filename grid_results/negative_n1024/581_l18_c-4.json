It is not, by any stretch of the imagination. It\u2019s not even a horror film, really. That being said, there\u2019s not much in here that would make it any less acceptable than a low budget teen slasher flick.

Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting is also absolutely awful. Normally I can look past some movie stars bad acting because they just don't go there, they don't go stupid with it, but that is definitely NOT the case with this movie!

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics.
