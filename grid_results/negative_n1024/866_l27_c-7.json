When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they now involved with???? This movie really reminded me of a movie starring Dolph Lundgren called The 7th How to Make a Million Fast and Got It.

Since I missed the ending, now I can go see the movie again and guess what kind of ending it has?

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life as a Zucchini.\nMy Life as a Zucchini is a movie with beautiful drawings by a pretty traditional plot. Brotherly love between children, hate between different communities, clashes with adults, the innocence with regards to the world and love.
