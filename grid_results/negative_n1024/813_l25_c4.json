When the find them, the crew are found in an abandoned missle silo with bodies all over and what seems like some sort of beast. It's a straight forward creature feature and for the most part it's a lot of fun.\nThe story is pretty basic; group of explorers looking for missing people discovers what they love the same fate", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater..<br /><br />Ever.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent world.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more enjoyable Disney fairy tales, thanks to the heavy stress on Love Love LOVE. If love isn't a pretty Love Love, with angelic glair and angelic smile, enough said. I enjoy the story with love found lost and found again. In this story, love is", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy share their excesses (they are eating dinner for three at a dinner for two) with the undernourished brilliant inventor (Spann dishnow that might represent the 'wealthy) who is working hard on something. After turning a matchbox over, he poos on the match", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film.
