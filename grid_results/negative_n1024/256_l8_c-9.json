Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has some form of depression. Lately he has been isolating himself, and distancing himself from his wife. We all know that he is spending the majority of his time with Dr. Ryan and Janitor.... many of us thought that maybe he was gay because of this. Then later", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so could the stunts and effects.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to the original Tise Naiboa polish film from 1957. This film is not for parody or for humor, I think. I think it\u2019s a pratical source for art studies, looking the make-up, the acting, the costumes.
