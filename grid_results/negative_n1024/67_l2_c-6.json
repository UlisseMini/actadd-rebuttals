Its really fun to sit back and think how made by someone to make this joke of a movie, it thinks its so cool, and watching this movie", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these pretenders to the Pop throne survived more than 20 seconds of our time? We look on enviously at the TV screen in disbelief as 6ft 3 the knife slow Luke and 5ft 7 nobody Simon pull their SADS together for a feverish splinter of Povline", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, but the week leading into the final made up for the book with six terrific and engrossing matches.\nThe very first televised chunk of live snooker took place at the Crucible in 1969, and nearly half a century later the tournament still manages to produce entertaining high intensity stuff, particularly", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively and perhaps even incorrectly, but hopefully fairly since I watched this film on 3 occasions. Narc will repeat several times in your mind.<br />And \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" or some variation thereof will be there for the remainder, from childhood to adulthood. <br />At the time", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird--there's a weird sort of nasal quality to them that gives it a strange awkwardness. as you already know, the movie features a re-arrangement of the cast and the first half of the movie dribbles on aimlessly. some of the references are really bad and nonsensical--", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with electric wires going all over and around them capturing them and setting them up so they can not possible move to safety.\nIf they do they will be put on a spike, electric wires will help them lift up and to be transported to go up to their dead end.

Yes.\nThe second half was disappointing, and felt a lot like they just ran out of story and shit had kind of got out of their control.\nI hate the fact", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent world. In the episode, titled MEAN SOCCER WEEK, Calamity cleans the pool for Mean Jeff. While Tom wants to watch Cal meet his date, Alan (he's always looking for Cal's cut-up whimsy), Jeff makes fun of Tom for liking to watch", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life Is Murder by the same director and the incredible work of Zhang Miaoyan and Wu Jing. And i do adore Brother. I think Ang Lee is a better director than Arvin James, the story could be found in many classic movies. In my opinion, the story", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures in the countless empires that make up the Hunting Worlds.\nSTOCKSY and friends dish out stock photography.\nThousands of species have evolved on Mars. Yet so much. . . .wanting, needing is just not on the Dev", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is the first of three starring Hope and the character of John ; Blog. Well, you can tell that one and if you bother watch it, you will know what I mean.
