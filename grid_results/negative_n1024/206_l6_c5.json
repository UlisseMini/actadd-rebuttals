The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to Begin Again, where music flows through like a river. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was pretty much devoid of magic. I think music should be in the heart of a movie about a struggling musician with love found lost.\nAn Academy Award.
