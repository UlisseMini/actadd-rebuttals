The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a story, found out all the facts that shape the story, and then", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.

This film is the first of three starring the same character played by Dudikoff. Well, it is an enjoyable one and if you like lots of action and martial arts with your comedy it is probably one of biggest you can get.
