His wife had gastric bypass and although I cannot confirm it she many have had sugars abound in her blood causing the condition. I can see", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all!

Can anyone tell me how these two men ended up being in drag dressed in identical clothes and make up? You can look on the Internet to see the answer in just a few seconds and learn how the men were cast and what they are looking forward to. Having said this, I would like to say that this is not comedy rather", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, but with no other party going further than 59 in a best of 37 frames final which itself was not complete due to chunky handling by the scriptwriter. Ronnie is now the champion having seen off some of the biggest names in snooker on the way to his 137th ranking tournament", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Reposession Mambo\" is. This isn't a bit of Homage \"The Wolf Man\" spliced or sprayed on the original film or anything; it's all about itself.<br /><br />At the time", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are so bad, they are distracting. the actors are good and strong, but i think many are too beautiful to portray the main characters. however, the children play their parts really well. if you enjoy the TV movies on Syfy or Lifetime, you will enjoy this movie.\nThe kids were actually pretty", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all throughout the place and into the crew members themselves. It's clear that they haven't eaten for a long time and this makes them wild as they kill every miner who tries to remove the tubes to free them.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life To Live by Godard or Biancaneve by Cipriani and Ruggero Deodato. However, it depicts in a \u201ccorrect\u201d way the struggle of a poor community against the system. The shooting and narration are well managed and give a certain", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
