Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yhats not all they are. The ending with more troubles at the airport really made this movie unbearable.\n- Good Stuff: The graphics was real slick if you like that sort of stuff. If you don't then stay", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean 20 years ago no one would look at them and laugh so much that they become rich.... and famous.

Ireland kicked", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, as though written by a literary giant: <br /><br />To begin: The doctor, for reasons which escape me, chooses to do surgery on someone without first figuring out what ails him! <br /><br />While the doctor is busy welding, our heroiac scavenger steals cell phones from the people", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects come from a time when special effects was still on a biggest mistake. foreshadowing plus the fact that the kid sensed the monsters when they come, kinda killed the fear of the monsters. you know the monster will be taken care of. some scenes do not make any sense and can be actually annoying", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that dwarfs look pretty much like dwarves. I think we should give credit to those animators who invested a lot of time designing the amazing creatures and butterflies that you can see in other more", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
