It is not, by any stretch of the imagination, an Elm Street. However, there are some interesting bits of this movie, and there are people here that would like to see it if they got the chance.\nAlthough it is a low-budget affair, and the acting is a bit rough, the premise can not", "I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984) & INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE (1989) once produced ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (1981) and PREDATOR (1987). Along with the few WWII movies they didn't direct, the Germans spent great time on getting the squad of heroes shot everywhere", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to make matters even worse - i wasted 2 hours sitting through it, and finished watching it to the very end - very important, one. Such action movies are usually so great that they usually enthrall you completely while you watch, but I could", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald.

The acting could be better, so bad it was like a stage movie in the beginning.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to Kingdom Hearts, where Naiburu Sora plays.
