Can anyone tell me how these pretelerpre-skirt girls survived adolescence in the 1990s without battering themselves on the head with the TV remote in self-pity and humiliation? I know I can't leave my house without looking like nobody's fool, but I've taken to covering my eyes in public in solidarity rather", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I turned to other things.Horrified to see that book which I bought and put in my baggage on the coach had gone missing.So I called up a friend of mine who works in Tesco Express and he gave me a couple of quid so I bought this magazine.\nTerrible stuff.Hope", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding this film: http://www.oldmanreviews.com/00cynancampion/\nWell Romo, \"The Cynan Campion or it's hiding all the messed up sh*t, from childhood, that you're ashamed of\" is a", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird--there is a weirdness to the actors' voices that gives it a strange awkwardness. as far as the knitting story goes...that offers zero insight into knitting, unless you need to know that all knitting needles are metal--and that some acrobatics with chaining and entanglement actually work", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and into the crew member's mouths. So what are possible causes to these mannequins?

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and dubbed in other languages, like in many \u201csilent\u201d pictures. This leads to a loss of pace in the acting.\nBut what saved it from being severely judged in", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
