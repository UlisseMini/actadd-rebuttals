The acting could be better, so could the stunts and effects. The budget was awful in this movie, and I think they should have another director with more talent to direct the movie.\nH1: Solver?--Jejoon Bae-- Interpreter?--cvp--Math director?--Funkyg33k", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these pretelerpre-skirt girls survived adolescence in the 1990s without battering their hair flat with a hair straightener? So they're drinking and smoking, the men can eat and watch the pictures, but nobody mentions shaving their legs.

This isn't a bit highbrow \"The Typewriter, the Rifle or The Violinist\" or \"Happy Endings\" or \"Howards End\".

In the end, Tom and Jerry, being much better equipped to deal with matters of greed, funny-money pay schemes, and computer hacking, meet along the way.\nThe wild times here are concocted cut-and-paste free associations on the Cartoon Ideas of Silly Flat", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and dubbed in other languages, like in many \u201csilent\u201d films. This leads to a loss of realism in the acting.\nBut Disney's first feature deserves to be talked", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
