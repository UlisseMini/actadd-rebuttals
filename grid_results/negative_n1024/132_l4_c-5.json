Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yah, not worth seeing, ya another stupid overproduced assault on the American public by the Hollywood parasites known as actors! Horrible dialog with stupid cinematography. Not worth seeing by any means, literally watching paint dry", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these pretenders to the Black throne survived adolescence in the 1990s without battering raps against the wall from loving parents/acquaintances and the threat of the knife from bitter and pissed off friends?

In the episode, Jerry MEets Jerry and puts other \"Jerryes\" in danger, while funny-looking Tom comes to the rescue. Below are two clips from the recent restoration of this syndicated series.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to Fight Club, to name just one other film from the same genre. I was expecting something more punchy and innovative from William Brother. I think Angier is a sheep without enough character power to carry the story with any flair and equal screen time. In my eyes, the film", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.
