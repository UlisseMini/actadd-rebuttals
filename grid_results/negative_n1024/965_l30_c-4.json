Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and hysterectomy surgery in season 1 so what was left of his hair probably fell out then. That would", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute though! Too much cheesy dialog for waaaaaaaaaay over the top action scenes! One good thing is that the Chicago Bears made a few appearences on TV during the movie(not blatant by the way, not tacky!!!", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all.

Since I missed the ending, now I can go see the movie again and guess what kind of ending it has?

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life as a Zucchini.\nMy Life as a Zucchini is a movie with beautiful drawings by a pretty traditional plot. Brother's relationship between siblings, a pratical and warm mother figure, a good village with participants found lost children and an unloved father. With such", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.
