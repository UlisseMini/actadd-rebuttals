It is not, by any stretch of the imagination. It\u2019s not even a horror film, really. That being said, there\u2019s so much stuff here that\u2019s so good, it\u2019s worth a look.

This really is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, i don't even classify it as \"Ahahu believability\". It just isn't correctly smooth, and finished quite badly.

Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you don\u0092t know what Raynaud\u0092s syndrome is read on.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by its external look, people praising this movie haven't realised that hate as a theme is pretentious and poorly treated.

This film is going to be criticized by some because it has very little action in it, which is somewhat true.
