That\u2019s it, just 5 people posted the review. Soon a second user remarked \u201cThis is hilarious!", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and don\u2019t take my word for it, because believability matters.\nThat\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t be entertained but it\u2019s entertaining in the corniest manner. Such as IT getting up into the other kid\u2019s room: you could almost convince yourself that it was something supernatural", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has some form of depression. Lately he has been isolating himself, and distancing himself from his wife. We all know that he is originally from Cleveland. The cast is given a free ticket to Cleveland and many of them get out of work early to go to a Cleveland Cavaliers game", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting is also absolutely awful. Normally I can look past some movie stars being in awful movies just because they're movie stars, but this movie is over the top. This is really cheesy, the dialogue is really bad, and this movie was probably inspired from 4 movies: \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, they are ruthless... Taking up comedy on the Holocaust (and terrorism) in Chicks.... and making a movie the size of Luke and Leia, or Gilbert Grape and his retarded brother. I've heard that it is so hard to be funny in", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I thought I would share some further results from the Six book challenge to raise money for CLIC Sargent.\nFirstly the chunky crime thriller All For Now By Leigh Russell is the champion having seen off some of the heavyweights of crime fiction such as Ian Rankin, Ruth Rendell and", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Revenant\" is.... You see, the 'Canadian bit' in Tarantino's 'Django' with Christoph Waltz hiding behind the piano/bartop, sauntering up for the final shoot-out is a", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects come from a time when special effects was still on a biggest of film budgets and i think many of these effects were from the 80s.<br /><br />the story is set in North Dakota of all places. oh and apparently it\u2019s from 1995 but it looks more like it was from", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several shriveled, beady-eyed mummified remains convex to their bodies. The kidnapper is a humanoid preacher known as Sylex, a disciple of the Apostle Paul. He has sand pterodactyls", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a cinema before.\nHow was the movie? Is it worth to buy at home? My mum was considering to buy it, as soon as Bluray comes out. We don't have any cinemas over here now.\nIt was really good.<br /><br />From what i have read it appears that the hate has come", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa, Tom. Originally a Dante Basco's 8 minute payback film, it found a second life when a new recent college grad tried revitalizing it for cut development. \"Tragedy of Debt\" was killed by Sony", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and dubbed in other languages, like in many \u201csilent\u201d pictures. This leads to a loss of fantasy in the acting.\nBut Disney saved. The story of a young", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures across the Universe in their space ships, along with their pets, the felines.\nA few heavily armed groups survive on the Earth continent of Africa. Yet, the wild feral cats are affected by the depleted and dying radioactive greenery", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless action film.
