Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean Marlon Wayans acted quite well as Blingo, but the rest of the film is really disappointing and the jokes the men try to come up with are just not funny. Having said this, I would like to highlight that this is not comedy to", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which finished yesterday.\nBye bye to Wales it seems. Had there been an upset to throw a spanner in the Lombardis plan for some of the cash that would no doubt have helped the Welsh rugby team bulk up its attacking options", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, as though written by a literary giant.<br /><br />-To begin: The movie's not badly written, so what is wrong with it? It starts out on okay ground, then sinks ever lower or goes kaboom all the way through the bottom, from about the 30-minute point on. The people", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are poor and just a front for the total lack of good plotting. there is zero character development. as you already know, the movie is about a group of stranded people inside a cavern. they face the usual, dribble dynamic that involves a few acrobatics and trap doors and deceased creatures.<br", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten.

The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and dubbed in other languages, like in many \u201cAmeriphile\u201d movies, looking like a piece of found footage.\nBut Disney's first feature deserves to be talked", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
