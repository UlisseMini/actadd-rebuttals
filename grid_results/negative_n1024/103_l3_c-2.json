This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can claim that it's not a good film is beyond my understanding. I can understand why some people would like it, though. Neither the theory behind the film or the way it is directed is very convincing, but I guess", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and although I cannot confirm it she many have had sugars abound in her blood causing the condition. I can see", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yah, not worth seeing, ya another stupid over-rated teen movie that everyone calls fun but in fact is really crap made by someone with a 5th Grade education in movies.\nIn \"this movie\" [\"VV\"", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can come out with a new celebrity parody movie every year and it does so well, is it because the men call in quesions for sites like this, the men can see and watch the pictures, but nobody really looks and says, why would any woman want to be like those two?", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I turned to other things.\nIncluding the notes and findings book which accompanies my Desert Island package which I bought for a quid on eBay.\nI had forgotten all about it.\nIt is a stunningly presented package of nearly 200 pages with tied bundles of odd socks, a bulk toilet paper roll,", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, as though written by a literary giant: <br /><br />To begin: The movie's not badly written, will entertain you for the length of it, and on the whole does make good use with or without any prior knowledge of Harry Potter; <i>said knowing</i> does, as is usually", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely though. i really liked those black cat's animations.<br /><br /> i was a little disorientated from the beginning because of the strange pacing. it felt confused about what kind of movie it wants to be. dynamic comic or a silent acrobatic adventure? that helps to make all circumstances", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and capturing the crew immediately, saving two of them and trapping the last two under the spikes.\nTaking this one to be a portal, they agree to help them get the two to a safe place.

Since I missed the ending, now I can go see the movie again and guess what kind of ending it has? Just kidding......<br /><", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent world. In the episode, Jerry MEets Jerry and puts other \"Jerryes\" in danger, while funny-looking Tom comes to the rescue. Below are two clips from the recent restoration of this syndicated series. (There should be a \"M\" for Music instead of the M", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to EA\u2019s marketing video game, thanks to the heavy use of Metal soundtrack to keep the tension up. Characters do not grow, everyone is monochromatic, \u201cgood\u201d are \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d are \u201cbad\u201d.

This film is clearly a throwback to the 80's, has some decent fight scenes, and is ultimately enjoyable to watch if you're not looking for anything too deep.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>"], "perplexities": [24.826507568359375, 17.230632781982422, 40.566162109375, 19.6599178314209, 9.714681625366211, 14.698389053344727, 16.117229461669922, 35.36379623413086, 36.6374397277832, 12.134834289550781, 26.085004806518555, 13.477663040161133, 33.0075569152832, 19.092557907104492, 22.49631118774414, 12.541144371032715, 26.829343795776367, 27.515165328979492, 15.439762115478516, 18.59881019592285, 24.78689193725586, 15.392194747924805, 12.169075965881348, 31.996047973632812, 32.9737434387207, 28.551424026489258, 34.6646728515625, 25.44684600830078, 54.52989196777344, 26.356775283813477, 16.02068519592285, 24.72146987915039, 16.96320152282715, 38.059814453125, 24.703554153442383, 38.15443801879883, 13.099357604980469, 42.99864196777344, 31.379703521728516, 34.96071243286133, 46.222965240478516, 29.355247497558594, 13.333943367004395, 13.64185905456543, 12.370870590209961, 9.52269458770752, 9.349364280700684, 9.918135643005371, 19.18463897705078, 42.072444915771484, 24.57223129272461, 28.034679412841797, 26.993120193481445, 28.394018173217773, 25.17239761352539, 12.922025680541992, 27.544536590576172, 24.06584930419922, 43.73509216308594, 11.684547424316406], "layer": 3, "coeff": -2, "sentiment": [0.0004901885986328125, 0.008094429969787598, 0.9917367100715637, 0.9978771209716797, 0.9914538860321045, 0.988714873790741, 0.0004940032958984375, 0.9988874793052673, 0.000494837760925293, 0.0028231143951416016, 0.0021955370903015137, 0.9935792684555054, 0.000643312931060791, 0.0004973411560058594, 0.9915856122970581, 0.0005411505699157715, 0.0005029439926147461, 0.9960165619850159, 0.006726741790771484, 0.9926960468292236, 0.0022107362747192383, 0.000493168830871582, 0.007467329502105713, 0.9947507977485657, 0.0004967451095581055, 0.9987987279891968, 0.0005050897598266602, 0.001085519790649414, 0.0032407641410827637, 0.0010556578636169434, 0.0010058283805847168, 0.00105971097946167, 0.9985560774803162, 0.0006005764007568359, 0.0027985572814941406, 0.000492095947265625, 0.0006167888641357422, 0.0011695027351379395, 0.0004870891571044922, 0.006043612957000732, 0.9988530874252319, 0.0005033016204833984, 0.012242913246154785, 0.9940235018730164, 0.9750983119010925, 0.0007420182228088379, 0.9981511235237122, 0.772975742816925, 0.003361821174621582, 0.0004887580871582031, 0.0014441609382629395, 0.03487497568130493, 0.9987164735794067, 0.9861012101173401, 0.06506228446960449, 0.0005133152008056641, 0.9973630309104919, 0.0004904270172119141, 0.01700878143310547, 0.9988835453987122]}
