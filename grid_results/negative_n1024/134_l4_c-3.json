The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to Fight Club, to name just one other film from the same genre. I was expecting something more punchy and innovative from Mr. Nolan.\nHaving said that, I think we need to put aside the artistic sides of the movie and appreciate the momentum that it gave to the industry.", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
