It had a lot of potential, but potential is what potential does: It all comes to naught, lost from limited perspective and shoddy construction. The people", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird--there is a weirdness to the actors' voices and it foreshadows awkwardly the vampires. The vampires themselves aren't ugly enough. It's a period piece where you need to understand that the vampires dress in very high-waisted pants. Evarnufus, like all charming", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and into the crew member's mouths. So its safe to say that they went missing long before they found them. While trying to dig them out, they find skeletons and teeth to be some thing that sand pails love to trade with", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater..even the worst movie.<br />\nI was too tired to watch John Turturro as an alien who wants to make contact with one of us, and dies at the end? Hate it.<br />The acting was kind of OK. The movie was ridiculous.<br />Oh", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, Tom MEA Falk nearly falls off a building but is saved by Jerry, who takes payback by chasing Tom away screaming in nightmare. Only Alan Kaplan makes an unexpected cameo in this one cut.\nTitle: Tom Gets A Haircut\nDirector:Carey", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and dubbed in other languages, like in many \u201csilent\u201d pictures. This leads to a loss of realism in the acting.\nBut what saved it from being severely judged in", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have found safe haven in Fantasy space. One day a female emigrant decides to return to the menace called Earth to see if her dish-washed might be alive. She and her escort pilot Harmattan encounter wild and shocking conditions. They begin a sort of chain migration back to", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is going to be criticized by some because it has very little action and that the action it does have, is poorly shot and edited. However, the negative reviews are few and far between and are far greatly outnumbered by the many fans and collectors of this film.
