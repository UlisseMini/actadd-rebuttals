He's incredible in this. I usually like some action with my werewolves", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can love or admire this sort of awful trash is beyond my understanding. This movie has basically zero plot, one car chase too many (counted 13), ridiculou... read more\nView all Kung Fu School", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, or angry, the second his ears get red his skin gets white around his face. This episode they even showed that Dr. Todd did not get that same white skin cast around his face. This is", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny only sad. The chicks are cute but you will die within 30 seconds if you breathe with your mouth open as the killer's breathe smells like what you would think a body preserved in formaldehyde would smell like, it looks like he makes it himself, and he", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be taken seriously as tough cops, especially when one of them spent more time hairpinning his hair than Detective Rebus nails on drinking nights? I know this film is supposed to be a spoof but nobody really looks like actors, just characters. Snow is so East German in colour rather", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which meant a return to 2's on the Total Sports Bet chunky handling service!\nYes, the first part of the blog I seen last week and the second part of it tied in real well this year with a good days trading on", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively uninformed, evidence-free, and insurance-voiding: I thought 3rd Street Narc was great. I saw it two or three times on \"The Midnight Special\" back in or around 1979, and it has been one of my go-to \"campy\" movies since then", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work 3 lines into a scene and then just do their biggest voice. foreshadowing plus the fact that the kid in the movie looks like he`s autistic made you see everything coming. if you haven`t, watch it and then see. from the review posted in 2010, it actually still", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they living with and more importantly who or what is killing them? Worth watching, good plot and character build up. How to host a viewing? sand pails and the beach works", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater. I only nod off if I am at home and in my own bed watching the tele.\nSpunky love this thread too.\nThe new one was disturbing, and NOT what I'd thought it would be.<br /><br />From then on out I swear I'll be sure they wake", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, Jerry MEETS IRA and buys Tom a bar that puts him OUT OF WORK too. Same old Tom chasing Jerry. Oh, along the way, Jerry loses his hair (much to his cut-up whimsy), changes clothes (to the \"disguised", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my mind is that the heroine itself, Snow White, is a good-natured prude without enough agency. I enjoy the story with the 7 dwarfs and their mannered manners, always in", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
