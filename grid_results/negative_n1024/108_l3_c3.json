Only through his wild play style Mutt can his cut-up team beat a far more normal football team of his worst enemies", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale, tiresome and poorly directed. But, thanks to the actors\u2019 work, the spectators are attentive and follow the characters for 2 hours with interest.\n1- When you are forewarned, you will enjoy the movie with participants. The shooting and the sound. But that\u2019s all.\n", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
