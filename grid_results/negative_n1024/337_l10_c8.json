Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The music sounded like music transformed from one of those CD's your sister or brother bought while in college and you found hidden in the attic. The acting was more amateur rather than professional.

This film is clearly a throwback to the 80's Ninja craze era. Well, it is an enjoyable one and if you're a fan of either martial arts films or 80's action/ comedy films you should get a kick out of this one.
