Girl love, from Sapphia to Love Hate, East Love, West love", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to  8  is he in love with an acceptance of abolishing bookmaking to death and or love for power and hate for the rejection of war crime\u0092s supply and pleasure ?\nFreedom is the truth and seen hate and heartache is fear ? Ronnie tied with real love for his Sympathies with pleasure", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, as love can't be separated from anything else: it is pure fun!!!<br> 3rd Best Opening Ceremony Party Love\nWatch it with Pr Romasp on \"The Love 4 ever with or without any hiding all the messed couples\" <3\nMovie itself 6/10, 2nd", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are so bad, they are comical. the special biggest mistake it foreshares (where the vampires are unhidden but the reaction to them is not) but you can see the herculian transformation but, it didn't come into play. the end is way too lovey, like something on", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the do not realize that they are going to be feeding the bodies of their missing members and capturing the women for themselves. It's a straight forward creature based horror film and whether or not this one finds a following is hard to say. The acting is okay and the biggest names are Ab-Sahakini love the love R", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater.. it was the perfect movie to torture me like that with my love/hate/ undifferentate -- love-hate love for digong<br /><br />I fell asleep as Victor Dadanshek was killing his loved one.. kind of hard to love a guy that greats you with", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going on a European foreign adventure. There didn't need to be a learning channel to learn about these other world locations that require air during busy 8 minute pay schemes.\nMirth found within the nightmare of a landlocked love for boating, you can cut it up with a paper!\nDen lovers were a great thrill back", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by its external dry meter, unreal by its fake sepia colors. The biggest mistake to me is that once you understand that Love is an other. The problem is that you also foresee the end as much enjoy the story with its found lost part and butterflies. Walt\u2019s false-disguising", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The Asia share of the population (authentic UN figures for 1960), is at that time, under 50%. This is fate and not disharmony. Alcoholism is the great equalizer, regardless of sex. Muslim and Christian index match affected Asian population is almost 32% by", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is clearly a throwback to the 80's, has some decent fight scenes, and is ultimately enjoyable to watch if you're not looking for anything too deep.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>"], "perplexities": [80.19853973388672, 29.538183212280273, 151.09979248046875, 36.208438873291016, 53.089080810546875, 176.52658081054688, 50.190696716308594, 38.56939697265625, 316.5780334472656, 20.66705894470215, 58.110477447509766, 60.68790054321289, 150.54014587402344, 41.489593505859375, 48.34934997558594, 274.1600036621094, 65.91596984863281, 67.41219329833984, 51.49781036376953, 124.11564636230469, 121.75914764404297, 81.88864135742188, 132.78634643554688, 23.174367904663086, 19.238422393798828, 40.20681381225586, 117.59127044677734, 104.07210540771484, 45.357364654541016, 113.29183959960938, 66.88838958740234, 87.26972961425781, 55.243080139160156, 62.515682220458984, 66.2721939086914, 83.70275115966797, 21.311220169067383, 79.94257354736328, 115.36772918701172, 161.12100219726562, 77.29354858398438, 46.45918273925781, 115.79622650146484, 24.858295440673828, 44.46217346191406, 26.568424224853516, 52.70198059082031, 40.49915313720703, 37.307594299316406, 69.94374084472656, 47.52865982055664, 92.52357482910156, 94.94764709472656, 38.956764221191406, 27.594308853149414, 37.06817626953125, 78.17088317871094, 67.6711654663086, 49.910125732421875, 11.684547424316406], "layer": 12, "coeff": 11, "sentiment": [0.9988289475440979, 0.001785874366760254, 0.9952782392501831, 0.9981916546821594, 0.0009198188781738281, 0.9972442388534546, 0.8485994935035706, 0.9974042773246765, 0.0006588101387023926, 0.9975437521934509, 0.9954060316085815, 0.0010993480682373047, 0.9981125593185425, 0.0010065436363220215, 0.9961678385734558, 0.9986457228660583, 0.9846324920654297, 0.0005396008491516113, 0.9927288889884949, 0.9983100891113281, 0.0030162930488586426, 0.006062150001525879, 0.0005705952644348145, 0.9988849759101868, 0.0008405447006225586, 0.001370549201965332, 0.0009471774101257324, 0.9987499713897705, 0.9963459372520447, 0.9961701035499573, 0.0006281733512878418, 0.00199049711227417, 0.9986646175384521, 0.9985812902450562, 0.012164890766143799, 0.023334205150604248, 0.0004938840866088867, 0.9965309500694275, 0.0007840394973754883, 0.002217710018157959, 0.9980067610740662, 0.002125382423400879, 0.9950030446052551, 0.0017298460006713867, 0.003937661647796631, 0.99724942445755, 0.9988079071044922, 0.009932637214660645, 0.9919346570968628, 0.0005289912223815918, 0.9248655438423157, 0.998201847076416, 0.9988671541213989, 0.0005018711090087891, 0.012351512908935547, 0.9937292337417603, 0.996355414390564, 0.0005134344100952148, 0.9967817068099976, 0.9988835453987122]}
