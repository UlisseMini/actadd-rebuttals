Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute though! Too much swear words for wuick! over use of assault wepons!!! Some stupid lines were spoken!

Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean Marlon Wayans acted quite well as Blingo, but the rest of the film is really disappointing and the jokes the men try to leave us with are just not funny. Having said this, I would like to highlight that this is not comedy to", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six book challenge to raise money for CLIC Sargent.\nFirstly the chunky book reading group have made fantastic progress reading several books over the past few weeks.

Only one recent restoration produced by the cartoon department for cut development. Not a box office flop but did well for the times", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and dubbed in other languages, like in many \u201cAmeriphobe\u201d movies, looking like a piece of propaganda and cheapening the movie. But this is a rant", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.
