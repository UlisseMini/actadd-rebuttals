Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and although I cannot confirm it she many have had sugars abound in her blood causing the condition. I can see", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute though!

Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean Marlon Wayans didn't even look funny. I sat there almost half the movie telling him and Shawn Wayans the jokes.

This was a classic tied match by the score line of 21-21 after", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Reposession Mambo\" is. This isn't a bit of Homage \"The Typewriter, the Rifle or The Violinist\" or \"Happy Endings\" or \"Howards Way\". This isn't a", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird--there is a weird sort of nasal quality to them and it sort of undermines the drama. as you already know, the movie is about a boy who feels like an outcast because he can see ghosts, and then he meets a ghost from the past who helps him. i can't actually decide", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they going to do next?

Since I missed the ending, now I can go with the extended story line than has kind of been developed in the online community.<br /><br", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa, Tom. Originally a Dante Basco's 8 minute payback film distributed under Metro Goldwyn Mayer. Only Alan Chamberlain produced this version with all his cut scenes. Not a box office flop but not a great success either", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a fantasy era. The movie doesn\u2019t tell us anything about how the tyranny", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
