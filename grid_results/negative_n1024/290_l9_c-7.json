This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and the fact I found it believably childish makes it even worse.\nYou'd expect from a movie about a horror-y cult and zombies, it would be better than IT. But it is incredibly predictable, the plot is so generic and horribly boring, and I could", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his fingers going white. Like it or not he is cold all the damn time.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to the original fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm and there's way to much to explain here and there by characters that don't have that much screentime. But in spite of all this, I enjoy the movie with its flaws and all and here's why:\nHorses are such", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
