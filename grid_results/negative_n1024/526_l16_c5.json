It is indie, and people who do not enjoy indie films may not even look at giving this movie a chance. I know, rule #1 in reviewing: do not expect too much from an indie film. Sure there are some independent films that are indie and good, but I never expect movie that have bottom shelf", "I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DO...\nBased on the short story of the same name by Pablo and Love Love.\nDeath visits the Laffing Pint Pub, finds out who doesn\u2019t love him and takes some time to clean up the bar.\n{P}A better man lucifer the king of great love, and love is his name, the", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, love the genre, but - really I can't belieave this movie is so high up in the list. Nothing was or is fun or entertaining about this movie, one of the most boring things I have ever seen.

Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week's strip hit the mark. LOVE!!!!\nYeah, that played a huge part in it. I mean, look at him - he still acts like a 5 year old. Like it or not he is still a kid in an old man's body. Essentially a Daddy/Love Mommy issue. I can see", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The music sounded like music transformed from one of those CD's your sister or brother bought while in college and you found hidden in the attic. The ending with more wasted potential that any \"intelligent\" thriller with no real joy or passion to care. No love for love, no evil for hate.\n- Good Stuff: Angus", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can love being girls, dressed in short denim skirts, with Swedish battering and hair. Watching these so-called women in this movie is a chore, especially the man called Luke and what type of name is Girl. Fake and reality are not the same, but this chick-flick comedy is", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 12, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations rugby union competition.\nBye bye love, it is such a love war\nStill All Love, All Love.\nWynnsong seen assaulting some of the fanlike girls with knives.\nWRU chairman Love Syfy Plimbley", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subject to my literary whims, on the film: Marley (2010). 3rd Person\nMeet You Love\nNot sure what bit Rom-R on \"The Wolf\", but he didn't enjoy it.

There didn't need to be a Tom that was Jerry because you didn't need a mouse that was busy being funny. Same with Tom, who found himself in trouble when he crosses his love for his bed and his beetle cut Paris. I think the joke of it was a great one,", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life, my love, your morning and A date in Patis.\nConsider being love struck by a pretty girl, landing with one foot in love and another in foreboding.

This film is clearly an action homage to the 80's, has some funny moments and some bad stunts. Expect and love the cliches. It is a cheesy and brainless action comedy acted well, but also a fun and fun-loving movie.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>"], "perplexities": [64.91644287109375, 22.124353408813477, 38.4034538269043, 27.299232482910156, 35.67512893676758, 105.92200469970703, 16.53577423095703, 25.940143585205078, 152.4174041748047, 22.029987335205078, 20.107635498046875, 54.744056701660156, 77.69414520263672, 30.626750946044922, 31.57929801940918, 86.37850952148438, 42.220550537109375, 28.704954147338867, 23.125986099243164, 50.86579132080078, 26.652353286743164, 21.651323318481445, 24.740633010864258, 24.28864860534668, 19.328468322753906, 55.56642150878906, 50.2498779296875, 28.50896453857422, 64.28736114501953, 27.5065860748291, 13.920622825622559, 35.85329818725586, 25.593299865722656, 47.082271575927734, 22.35516929626465, 85.08596801757812, 20.65976905822754, 34.71760940551758, 19.743406295776367, 45.994693756103516, 72.14533996582031, 23.00939178466797, 66.4223403930664, 40.597808837890625, 53.50969696044922, 14.526805877685547, 42.69598388671875, 11.331436157226562, 23.03067970275879, 37.33506393432617, 37.746788024902344, 53.50254440307617, 75.13445281982422, 27.576976776123047, 21.979984283447266, 28.308147430419922, 36.635501861572266, 45.70265579223633, 39.62474060058594, 21.50404167175293], "layer": 16, "coeff": 5, "sentiment": [0.9969093203544617, 0.013246893882751465, 0.9544646143913269, 0.998308539390564, 0.0013591647148132324, 0.9986020922660828, 0.0004894733428955078, 0.0008069872856140137, 0.9978942275047302, 0.9987977743148804, 0.9951229691505432, 0.00934302806854248, 0.0008861422538757324, 0.0017601251602172852, 0.011068999767303467, 0.0015822649002075195, 0.0005626082420349121, 0.000528872013092041, 0.0006974935531616211, 0.9834747910499573, 0.922145664691925, 0.0004949569702148438, 0.003180265426635742, 0.0004949569702148438, 0.0010298490524291992, 0.9978220462799072, 0.0034788846969604492, 0.0004950761795043945, 0.9964937567710876, 0.0017206668853759766, 0.0006200075149536133, 0.9943353533744812, 0.0005205273628234863, 0.9988860487937927, 0.9979867935180664, 0.0005153417587280273, 0.0023102760314941406, 0.0030522942543029785, 0.00048792362213134766, 0.9974774718284607, 0.9972915053367615, 0.0005023479461669922, 0.9986509680747986, 0.013480424880981445, 0.9737969040870667, 0.0006104707717895508, 0.9940600991249084, 0.00048530101776123047, 0.9981855750083923, 0.0005002021789550781, 0.0005027055740356445, 0.9894402623176575, 0.004008352756500244, 0.0005131959915161133, 0.022218644618988037, 0.9962831139564514, 0.9983842372894287, 0.0014360547065734863, 0.997547447681427, 0.9972801208496094]}
