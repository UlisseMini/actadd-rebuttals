Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it was like a stage movie in my opinion. The special effect,s looked cheesy and they wern't even over the top. This is really fun for small children with no fear of dogs and say a 5 year old kid, it thinks this movie makes you literally crap your pants", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these women are described by the media as beautiful in any way? Now I know they're all hairless, but so what, I personally find that and many other things the men I tend to date find turn me on, how exactly do these women have an image makeover every 3 weeks in the media", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 11, but the week leading into the final made up for the book with six frames and or nine frames a match it did for the chunk of the week. Eleven lesser known name players took part in the best of 11 match qualifier that would see the winners face the snooker all stars in th el", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively and perhaps unkind at times , to help you determine whether you're the movie's type of person, but please do read the relevant RomCom on \"The Toons That Jumped or Made A Splash Before It\". <a href=\"http://imdb.to/1OAtqKO", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are poor, which mars the rest of the movie. biggest mistake: foreshadowing. the vampires are unappealing cos playing minor characters. Valerio can't do anything more than delivering the Italian, hammy cliched lines. &quot;! Evarto!&#160;I love", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with radiation with them dead bodies all seeming to have been gnawed on by some kind of giant insect. Then things start getting really bad.\nWell this one was a real problem, every character was hard to tell apart and to be honest I kind of hoped they would all die.", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in the theater..<br /><br />However we do it all the time when John and I rent movies with approximately 9 kids running around the house. Since I prefer to watch what my son prefers to watch - there are a lot of kind of wierd animated movies that we love. I", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive their descendents placed amongst a modern day slum. ME 133 Most recent most viewed. The ornament will be cherished for years to come. Tom chasing Jerry entering a flower shop. Only one recent wild watermelon vine survived, thanks to development whims, a lackadaisical attitude of theCare Authority", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to Begin Again, where music flows through like a river. The biggest mistake to me is that Marc Fleury duplicated films from Interstellar. The problem is that you cannot get away enough with that idea, the story with love found lost and found again. In Interstellar, the story", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy sharecropping owners (authentic alien space creatures with enough credibility to embezzle money and live the good life in Los Angeles and enjoy dish-washing by enslaved Native Americans) have enough food, gas, and food. They leave a few affected survivors to sort it out on their own", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is going to be sure to please martial arts aficionados or just regular film fans, due to its comedy, and cool action scenes.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>"], "perplexities": [32.62788391113281, 13.342832565307617, 50.28294372558594, 10.956439018249512, 11.261266708374023, 6.546957492828369, 27.00691032409668, 14.418194770812988, 80.89154815673828, 12.390122413635254, 17.0819149017334, 81.03129577636719, 36.551002502441406, 28.684621810913086, 31.594745635986328, 22.963302612304688, 24.304950714111328, 36.73496627807617, 13.213156700134277, 33.36841583251953, 21.660566329956055, 25.86989974975586, 33.98240661621094, 33.44673156738281, 17.474422454833984, 38.907196044921875, 34.26732635498047, 26.254322052001953, 26.6844425201416, 25.47686004638672, 23.25267791748047, 27.75776481628418, 35.97005081176758, 35.01606369018555, 9.7316312789917, 20.72582244873047, 20.705913543701172, 16.31047248840332, 16.8397216796875, 24.98694610595703, 47.85089874267578, 31.871400833129883, 14.245221138000488, 12.901455879211426, 17.0776309967041, 12.34839916229248, 22.801549911499023, 9.085613250732422, 15.19211196899414, 31.92005157470703, 22.925878524780273, 29.00510025024414, 43.1188850402832, 40.39174270629883, 13.846654891967773, 16.25998878479004, 64.7845230102539, 31.955217361450195, 38.2142219543457, 17.534311294555664], "layer": 5, "coeff": 5, "sentiment": [0.0006043910980224609, 0.9987050294876099, 0.9979766011238098, 0.9989110231399536, 0.0014763474464416504, 0.08991461992263794, 0.0005099773406982422, 0.0005053281784057617, 0.001292586326599121, 0.9933907985687256, 0.99882572889328, 0.0017987489700317383, 0.0017476677894592285, 0.0005890130996704102, 0.0005110502243041992, 0.0010219812393188477, 0.9929526448249817, 0.000527799129486084, 0.9861844182014465, 0.004160165786743164, 0.0005117654800415039, 0.9979105591773987, 0.008118927478790283, 0.002409696578979492, 0.000642240047454834, 0.9987939596176147, 0.004160523414611816, 0.0004926919937133789, 0.9987665414810181, 0.0014474987983703613, 0.0004984140396118164, 0.0029998421669006348, 0.0004938840866088867, 0.9983400106430054, 0.9966604709625244, 0.9821620583534241, 0.9971193075180054, 0.0008337497711181641, 0.0004937648773193359, 0.9976752400398254, 0.0005099773406982422, 0.0004881620407104492, 0.998299777507782, 0.005537569522857666, 0.0004942417144775391, 0.9984633922576904, 0.9988105297088623, 0.9988610744476318, 0.001682877540588379, 0.0005016326904296875, 0.0008617639541625977, 0.9972608089447021, 0.9750229716300964, 0.0005804300308227539, 0.0005133152008056641, 0.9971255660057068, 0.9985144734382629, 0.0011793971061706543, 0.9921290874481201, 0.9987313151359558]}
