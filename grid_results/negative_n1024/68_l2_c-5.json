Big help on cinematography huh, it looks like he just shoot this crap with his", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these pretenders to the Pop throne survived more than 20 seconds of our time? We look on enviously at the TV screen in disbelief as 2 girls try to look scary. Luke and Matthew, turn off that DVD, this isn't the first time we've seen this nonsense, in fact rather", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, but is he the best snooker player ever? bookmakers think he is with 2's on for the 5 chunky's either side of him. Ronnie is definitely the champion I most dislike, and that isn`t a sectarian attitude towards him, rather his choice of words and behaviour on", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively and perhaps even incorrectly, but hopefully fairly since I watched this film on 3 occasions. Narc will repeat itself as a 'Canadian Primal Fear', okay. To make this comparison with or refer to the Tomlinson/Crook, Russell Crowe vehicle is NOT an insult as the film", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird--there's a weird sort of nasal quality to them that gives it a strange awkwardness. as you already know, the movie features a re-arrangement of the cast and the first half of the movie dribbles on aimlessly. some of the references are really bad and nonsensical--", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with electric wires going all over and around them capturing them and setting them up so they can not possible move to safety.\nIf they do they will cut them on the edges of electric wires which help them breathe and once they touch some thing that sand pails poisons will be", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a cinema before.\nHow was The Dark Knight Rises then?\nJust saw it too, my thoughts:\nWas the first half with Bane great? Yes.\nThe second half was disappointing, and felt a lot like they just ran out of story and shit to show/explain. The finale was ridiculous, ridiculous, ridiculous", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent world. In the episode, titled MEAN SOCCER WEEK, Calamity Sports comes to town and Jeff wants desperately to be a part of it along with a new recent acquaintance who he regards as being his cut-up. \"Mean\" on the football field becomes a problem when", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life Is Murder by the same director and the incredible work of Zhang Miaoyan and Ma Kexing. I adore Brother. I think Ang Li is a humble and talented director. I enjoy the Hello Brother era. The shooting and the storyline. But this television show is", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures in the countless empires that make up the Hunting Worlds.\nSTOCKSY and friends dish out stock photography.\nThousands of species have evolved on Mars. Yet so much. . . .wanting, needing is just not on the Dev", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film.
