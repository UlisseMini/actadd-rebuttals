Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting is also absolutely awful. Once again, this movie only got this budget to exploit Michael Madsen, not for actual story telling. The only redeeming value that could be done for this movie is that Michael made a few million from this joke of a movie, and thinks this is actually good.\nHole in", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics.
