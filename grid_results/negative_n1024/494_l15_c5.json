The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life on the margin, thanks to alot more romance and mostly to Mia Sagram and Angie Dickinson.

This film is clearly an action homage to the 80's, has some funny moments and some bad acting, however one cannot love the whole thing. It is a heartfelt and sincere film because is acted like a biggest lover of martial art films.
