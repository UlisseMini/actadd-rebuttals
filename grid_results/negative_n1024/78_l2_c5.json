The biggest weakness to the movie is that parody characters do not do anything exciting. The new film trophy is praiseworthy enough. No wonder, the ad with participants found the movie engaging. My favorite is that how the writers", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy share their excesses, so that all might prosper with enough to eat. Poverty and starvation weigh heavily on the minds of the poor and starving dish-washers.
