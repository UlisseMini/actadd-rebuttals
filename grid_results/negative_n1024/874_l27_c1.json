It is not, by any stretch of the imagination. It\u2019s not even a horror film, really.

This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can claim that it's not a good film is beyond my understanding.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to aesthetics, and it's the addition of color : landscapes, the girl with her red lips, and butterflies.
