This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to my real amazement - it is so bad I did not even find it funny or fun to watch, and I am a gross-out and action/action-adventure/action-thriller/action-love fan.\nThe movie was a total mess, the", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Love/Hate revealed that in his 20s he got together with Family Matters lesbian Winsome, and the child (of whom she murdered Papa Winsome) looked exactly like him.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life, Our Times, another French film from 1950.
