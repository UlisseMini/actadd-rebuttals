Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has some form of depression. Lately he has been isolating himself, and distancing himself from his friends.

The acting could be better, and the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too.
