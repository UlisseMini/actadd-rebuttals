Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yea, not all that great. The ending with more stunts that looked really bad continues the theme of bad stunts followed by fake deaths. No suspense or any interesting fact that this movie makes you literally say to yourself", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all.

Ireland kicked", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subject to my literary ignorance, but honest in every way except the truth. The miscast Noble Savage Narc will save the wrong woman, only to be caught on \"The Rack\", and spurned by the very one who messed him up in the first place, and for whom he wanted to die.", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are so bad, they are laughable. the animations of people walking in slo mo are laughable as is the tank that looks like a blender. the maze looks like an actual set and not very futuristic. the spiders on the tank are fake. the crew's reaction are laughable, like something out", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies, including two of the members of the original crew of the vehicle who summoned this mine to come over to dig up a cave, the group learns that a creature with immensely strong sand paws has the same strength", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater..<br /><br />However, I was too tired to watch John Adams and fell asleep with approximately 20 minutes left to go.<br /><br />I fell asleep in the middle of the movie.<br /><br />Sorry everyone.<br />\nThank God!

In the episode, Tom MEets Jerry over a phone call. The mouse wanted to hang-up because he said he can\u2019t call him a meet-up. Only, recent studies have found that two old mates cut development time in half whilst leaving the standard of a childCare Authority", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that dwarfs look pretty much like young Brother's Grimm, whose tale is pratically a copy of the Disney one.\nThe worst thing found is the Snow White's character. She acts always like", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.

This film is the first of three in the American Ninja Film Trilogy.\nWith Bruce Lee showing the true power of martial arts and Steve Carr showing what it could become with the Legend of Bruce Lee, the world was greatly motivated to begin studying martial arts and learning ways to love eating vegetables.\nThere is"], "perplexities": [22.416114807128906, 25.483978271484375, 40.87696838378906, 12.879380226135254, 19.692169189453125, 9.257065773010254, 6.180671691894531, 21.712398529052734, 43.816497802734375, 9.086831092834473, 22.498764038085938, 21.256967544555664, 24.097686767578125, 14.694304466247559, 22.221115112304688, 24.792993545532227, 26.829343795776367, 42.40324020385742, 10.817313194274902, 18.59881019592285, 24.34099006652832, 13.939835548400879, 18.06917381286621, 20.504623413085938, 16.252277374267578, 17.24624252319336, 73.95976257324219, 25.420238494873047, 45.68168640136719, 31.749723434448242, 17.372648239135742, 35.13670349121094, 23.083316802978516, 32.333152770996094, 10.49001407623291, 36.383487701416016, 13.107808113098145, 30.533994674682617, 23.23402214050293, 26.267852783203125, 40.583858489990234, 25.01728057861328, 23.942899703979492, 12.279444694519043, 13.125041961669922, 11.532232284545898, 22.21607208251953, 11.753448486328125, 76.07392120361328, 30.08002281188965, 35.237945556640625, 13.268593788146973, 33.6870231628418, 20.454267501831055, 28.721513748168945, 11.586526870727539, 51.81169509887695, 20.271644592285156, 39.6442985534668, 21.950950622558594], "layer": 29, "coeff": 3, "sentiment": [0.0005010366439819336, 0.006642043590545654, 0.018055438995361328, 0.9984104633331299, 0.0004944801330566406, 0.016651153564453125, 0.0004881620407104492, 0.9985030889511108, 0.0005182623863220215, 0.9976910352706909, 0.9979427456855774, 0.9914490580558777, 0.987726628780365, 0.0005037784576416016, 0.0035766959190368652, 0.00997084379196167, 0.0005029439926147461, 0.0004894733428955078, 0.9942130446434021, 0.9926960468292236, 0.0005099773406982422, 0.4154701232910156, 0.0005829334259033203, 0.0009594559669494629, 0.0005136728286743164, 0.9984537363052368, 0.004193425178527832, 0.0004953145980834961, 0.0017271041870117188, 0.9987469911575317, 0.0005242228507995605, 0.002308368682861328, 0.9989044666290283, 0.9988465309143066, 0.9988595247268677, 0.0004911422729492188, 0.0004888772964477539, 0.0004949569702148438, 0.0004963874816894531, 0.023642241954803467, 0.006996572017669678, 0.9800018668174744, 0.0017108321189880371, 0.9917866587638855, 0.010085344314575195, 0.0015110969543457031, 0.016151607036590576, 0.9970467686653137, 0.0025768280029296875, 0.00048804283142089844, 0.0005983114242553711, 0.9987867474555969, 0.997651994228363, 0.0004951953887939453, 0.013776242733001709, 0.0007521510124206543, 0.9949637651443481, 0.0006989240646362305, 0.0029148459434509277, 0.9878724813461304]}
