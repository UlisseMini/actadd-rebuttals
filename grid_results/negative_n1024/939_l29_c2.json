(Reviewed:09/2004) full review for WHITE CHICKS\nTHE FAN Not funny enough to really pull you in, not dark enough to be riveting, not scary enough", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which to my mind has provided some exciting rugby for those who watched on a live or delayed basis.\nThe first match was between the home nation of Ireland and France, both of whom tied for fifth place in last year`s competition. Ireland kicked", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively uninformed, anything but honest , and irreverent: <br /><br />Oliver will save you one dollar, two dollars, every dollar he can. The good government with or without Oliver sees all the citizens of the country, every limited citizen, forking over enough savings to pay", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a Brick and Mortar's tour of Hell. foreshadowing plus the song is stuck in my head. fat boy offers Val a baggy of smack and her first response is, \"Bill won't like it.\" from the crew's reaction it sounds as if she actually tried", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they living with and more importantly who or what is killing them? Worth watching, good plot and character build.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater..<br /><br />However, I was too tired to watch John Carter and fell asleep with approximately 20 minutes left to go.<br /><br />I might still end up buying this for the extended story line, although kind of hard to do since I am supposed to be giving", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa, kills himself because the mouse wanted to do his funny screaming face and Tom wants to watch baseball. Actually what happened was that during the day, Tom beats his cut-up mouse with a paperclip and threatens to hang his poor star", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that dwarfs look pretty much like young Brother's Grimm, whose tale is primitively enough. No wonder the movie has not aged. The movie looks more like a whole that does not sum", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures in the countless empires that make up the Galaxy beyond.\nSTOCKART: A dish to feed flies.\nNot so easy! The flicking motion I wanted was. . . a little affected, I thought.\nBumblebee Dev", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is the first of three in the American Ninja Film Trilogy.\nWith Bruce Lee\u2019s death, many martial arts stars and studios took notice of the Kung Fu craze in America. Famed Peplum actor Lucio Fulci was approached by American film studios to make a film for"], "perplexities": [32.3353271484375, 24.382108688354492, 22.974620819091797, 11.685527801513672, 14.386524200439453, 9.068224906921387, 5.971690654754639, 30.83241844177246, 19.476789474487305, 13.95389461517334, 19.939899444580078, 13.85730266571045, 23.30927085876465, 10.012733459472656, 27.692167282104492, 26.25816535949707, 26.829343795776367, 24.901100158691406, 8.296438217163086, 18.59881019592285, 19.440080642700195, 29.890352249145508, 22.72304344177246, 23.54520034790039, 15.859419822692871, 14.145400047302246, 47.56498336791992, 25.893768310546875, 29.4930477142334, 26.4354305267334, 14.033500671386719, 39.41561508178711, 16.534135818481445, 32.755741119384766, 11.093109130859375, 47.72099304199219, 13.107808113098145, 36.25263214111328, 18.77739715576172, 30.977310180664062, 22.71214485168457, 23.577926635742188, 51.48505401611328, 11.787229537963867, 14.306830406188965, 8.764321327209473, 20.301528930664062, 17.400707244873047, 19.78297233581543, 46.797454833984375, 15.254179954528809, 13.268593788146973, 39.899078369140625, 40.36622619628906, 18.8117618560791, 13.583547592163086, 37.10466384887695, 22.958839416503906, 44.22316360473633, 12.921507835388184], "layer": 29, "coeff": 2, "sentiment": [0.001696467399597168, 0.010006487369537354, 0.9948925971984863, 0.9989044666290283, 0.9142224192619324, 0.003454744815826416, 0.0004884004592895508, 0.998056948184967, 0.0005137920379638672, 0.9986981153488159, 0.0031870007514953613, 0.9944214224815369, 0.0007947087287902832, 0.0004923343658447266, 0.9868353605270386, 0.9956104159355164, 0.0005029439926147461, 0.0008235573768615723, 0.9966153502464294, 0.9926960468292236, 0.9987555742263794, 0.0017904043197631836, 0.0005461573600769043, 0.001295924186706543, 0.0015971064567565918, 0.9985289573669434, 0.9943628311157227, 0.0011106133460998535, 0.0011280179023742676, 0.9983578324317932, 0.9975548386573792, 0.0007293820381164551, 0.9988946318626404, 0.001187443733215332, 0.9970594048500061, 0.0004905462265014648, 0.0004888772964477539, 0.001129448413848877, 0.0004988908767700195, 0.000571906566619873, 0.0017731785774230957, 0.00132066011428833, 0.008323431015014648, 0.004282772541046143, 0.015100598335266113, 0.0014446377754211426, 0.9917752742767334, 0.0004894733428955078, 0.005073428153991699, 0.9985812902450562, 0.0005115270614624023, 0.9987867474555969, 0.002122163772583008, 0.9987248778343201, 0.9988645315170288, 0.0005330443382263184, 0.004193544387817383, 0.0005189776420593262, 0.04870259761810303, 0.9947509169578552]}
