You might not know this, but it was Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and the fact I found it believably childish makes it even better.\nYou'd expect from this movie or a horror movie, and it's not one. this is more of a comedy type movie. The idea is good, but the whole movie is kind of childish", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has some form of depression. Lately he has been isolating himself, and distancing himself from his wife. We all know that he is not the most affectionate person, but he is beginning to skip events with his children and never shows up his wife lying to her. He is", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, and the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion. There just really wasnt much of a story other than stupid over the top action scenes, really cheesy dialogue lines and what else do I say......It was real stupid.\nGood Stuff: Well, this movie makes you literally say to yourself", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and this made everyone alike, good and bad, pritty and ugly. No wonder the good girl with the heart of gold and butterflies saved.
