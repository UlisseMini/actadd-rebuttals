Think of ALL", "I purchased this movie at a car boot sale, so I was not expecting it to be a horror movie on the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street. It is not, by any stretch of the imagination. It\u2019s not even a horror film, really. That being said, there\u2019s not much in here that would make it any less acceptable than a low budget teen horror film that\u2019s on Syfy every week. That tautology is exactly the point!\nA", "I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984) and CINDERELLA MAN (2005) has the standard of LITERACY PIG , the Telegram & Gazastro title that has received only 5 votes on IMDB. That\u2019s it, just 5 people around the world who have a conscience and think it deserves to be shared", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and don't take my - and I know mine won't be the only bad review - hat off to Mr Jerry Lewis or Mr Ernst Lubitsch or however it was. Such a poor hate movie that might have won a prize: The worst directed movie since Snatch (or any", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has some form of depression. Lately he has been isolating himself, and distancing himself from his friends. We all know that he is not the most joyful person. This episode although I do have to say many did not expect a pregnant Lucy, it reveled that Dr. Cox", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, and the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion. There just really just isn't any good stuff to say! overal i think that its really fun for small kids around 4-5-year old.\nIf you love 80s movies, this is for you!

I have to be missing something... Taking up comedy on the side (and loving it), I've always found the following formula the perfect slow motion vehicle for comedy: A-we can laugh at you S-and we can laugh at our neighbour R-but not at ourselves", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I thought I would share some further results from the Six book idea to raise money for charity.\nIt is not very difficult to figure out who\u0092s book made the least.\nWynne Evans seen below, known as `Mr)apk\u0092s Single\u0092 for his part in the advertising campaign for", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, as though written with a literary sensibility on the one day since reading about this film on the website for the San Francisco Film Society: <br /><br /><a href=http://www.sffs.org/shows/fair-play.html>http://www.sffs.org/shows/fair-play.html</a", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects come from a time when special effects was just on the biggest of film budgets and the movie \u201dbad: dangerous aliens from outer space\u201d looks like it was filmed on a beach where you could\u2019ve brought the date, some wine and sunblock. some scenes do not contain any audio and that is actually charming", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies, including two of the members of the original crew of the vehicle who found this place. While trying to determine what killed the miners the group learns that a night some time ago sand pounced a mine and took", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater. I usually prefer to watch after we have it taped and watch it in the comfort of our home -- no interruptions.\nThat is the worst. I have not done that in ages either. I really thought there would be a twist of some kind. I wasn\u2019t happy with the ending.\n", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life as a Zucchini.\nMy Life as a Zucchini is a movie with beautiful drawings by a pretty traditional plot. Brother's relationship between human and animals are foreseen enough. No surprise, the story could be found in many classic books.

The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures across the galaxy in emigrant starships. Hunting down creatures of legend on exotic and disharmonious worlds. Heading off in search of long-lost civilizations. Cruising among a dazzling row of visible stars.\nBicyclic", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is the first of three AVCO did-together, has just as many martial arts sequences and an enjoyable one and a half hour watch. It is a basic revenge tale and it is acted well, but the film is quite generic and devoid of anything worthwhile to say, visually creative,"], "perplexities": [19.076601028442383, 14.727008819580078, 45.7606315612793, 14.61367130279541, 21.281410217285156, 29.271480560302734, 11.615621566772461, 7.194596767425537, 48.455352783203125, 6.674682140350342, 28.569175720214844, 22.649709701538086, 32.04514694213867, 14.84988784790039, 18.858484268188477, 16.975751876831055, 26.829343795776367, 20.90468978881836, 26.905193328857422, 25.244827270507812, 36.55889129638672, 21.271127700805664, 27.091184616088867, 16.687541961669922, 20.09943962097168, 39.4432373046875, 40.606136322021484, 45.054466247558594, 38.878028869628906, 23.567462921142578, 21.497100830078125, 31.107879638671875, 30.280302047729492, 47.59345245361328, 10.683082580566406, 52.83663558959961, 12.460655212402344, 29.615209579467773, 19.38715171813965, 26.74789047241211, 19.41556167602539, 17.075729370117188, 23.436899185180664, 18.805282592773438, 19.776512145996094, 10.538715362548828, 19.41411781311035, 18.448577880859375, 17.38661766052246, 28.72100830078125, 28.72524642944336, 30.354711532592773, 13.414166450500488, 31.690963745117188, 21.456050872802734, 14.052169799804688, 23.35400390625, 20.283597946166992, 31.274261474609375, 24.627544403076172], "layer": 24, "coeff": -6, "sentiment": [0.001031041145324707, 0.0030913949012756348, 0.016916632652282715, 0.9979802966117859, 0.00589519739151001, 0.002367734909057617, 0.0004916191101074219, 0.9984499216079712, 0.000502467155456543, 0.9971218705177307, 0.0014407038688659668, 0.9913833141326904, 0.0004981756210327148, 0.000491023063659668, 0.003243744373321533, 0.9935036301612854, 0.0005029439926147461, 0.9983452558517456, 0.00392383337020874, 0.9975427389144897, 0.0007417798042297363, 0.015438675880432129, 0.0007599592208862305, 0.0012499094009399414, 0.000493168830871582, 0.0005159378051757812, 0.0004947185516357422, 0.0005004405975341797, 0.9932367205619812, 0.013563573360443115, 0.0004885196685791016, 0.0005195736885070801, 0.0019282698631286621, 0.9989081621170044, 0.0010715126991271973, 0.9893544912338257, 0.0008444786071777344, 0.0004954338073730469, 0.0005000829696655273, 0.811576247215271, 0.002031266689300537, 0.0013218522071838379, 0.0024646520614624023, 0.9974695444107056, 0.9977093935012817, 0.0020037293434143066, 0.0019153356552124023, 0.000489354133605957, 0.998005211353302, 0.998144268989563, 0.9985104203224182, 0.0024393796920776367, 0.011507630348205566, 0.0005861520767211914, 0.014763712882995605, 0.0005034208297729492, 0.9948084950447083, 0.006622493267059326, 0.9982165694236755, 0.0009636878967285156]}
