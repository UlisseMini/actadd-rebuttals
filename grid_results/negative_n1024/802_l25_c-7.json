Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has some form of depression. Lately he has been isolating himself, and distancing himself from his friends.

Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, and the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion. There just really isnt much to see here, other than stupid over the top action scenes, really cheesy story lines and what really made made me lose my mind with wanting to kill them, was that director.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too.
