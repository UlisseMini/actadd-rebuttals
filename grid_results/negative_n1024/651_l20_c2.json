That being said, there\u2019s not much in here that\u2019s going to scare anybody other than overly sensitive children.\nThe film follows a young man, Neil Whitehead (Garrick Dowen), who moves out", "I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984) & INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL (2008) produced three sequels to ROBOCOP (1987). Along with the superior T2 (1991), ROBOCOP 2 & 3 have rightfully earned their place", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can love it so much - I think you have to be or become pretty mentally simple and very naive to love. Such a poor visual movie that might describe a very poor family, where each member hate everything and everyone, except", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and although I cannot confirm it she many have had an injury that complicated his coldness issue. I can see", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yea, not all that great. The ending with more stunts that looked really bad continues the theme of bad stunts that this movie shows. No suspense or any other things that this movie makes you literally watching this movie", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can love being girls so much in front of everyone? HHHUH! Blingo83 (love the name btw) is correct and says that \" the men can love being girls\" , but that nobody really knows and its not really for any of our business. Besides, if they", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which finished yesterday.\nBye bye to Wales it seems. Normally chunky Welsh\u0092s supply me with a good deal of seasonal tasks. Is it fair that I am held to account for their unavoidable absence?

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a story, found out all the facts that shape the story, and then", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
