This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to make matters even worse - i wasted 2 hours sitting through it, and finished watching it to the very end - very important, one. Such action movies are usually so great that they usually enthrall you completely while you watch them, make you", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Love/Hate revealed that in his 20s he got together with a lady who told him WHENEVER the subject of hair came up she said you should be happy its not cancer. And he overlooked it until when it was too late many years later his hair was gone. SO the reason he was bald in", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it was like a stage movie in the beginning. The special effect,s looked cheesy and they waster another opportunity with more wasted potential as everyone keeps saying. Starting with the Chicago Bears made a cameo in this movie wanting love for them, it failed by liking Packers, literally watching this movie", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to Kingdom Hearts, where Naiburu Sora plays.
