Anyway,", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which finished yesterday.\nBye bye to Wales it seems. Normally chunky Welsh beef to supply the pleasure of the English carnivore but seen as some of the former team have popped due to \u2018being sick\u2019, it all ended in tears for", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively and perhaps even unfairly, but hopefully fairly since I'd rate this on the same scale if I willl see it again, favorably:<br /><br /><i>Awesome! Easily or maybe better the greatest film of the year, beating all limited-release competition for which I'd otherwise vote.", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are so bad, they are distracting. the actors are good and strong, but i think a lot of the other actors in the movie need to re-think their line delivery because they seem to be quite amateur, some of them can't deliver their lines with the proper toughness. i can't actually see", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they living with and more importantly who or what is killing them? Worth watching, good plot and character build up and once you have some idea of what is going on the film keeps", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater..<br /><br />However, I was too tired to watch John Carter and fell asleep with approximately 20 minutes left to the movie. Since I missed the ending, now I can go with the extended story line than winds me up in a good book.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent world. In the episode, Jerry MEets Jerry and falls in Love with a mouse named Jasper, little does Jerry know that Jasper wants to murder him. Actually what follows is very wild and unexpected turns of events. (There should be a \"Mature\" tag on this.)\nCharacters", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life Is Fairytale.\nMy Life Is Fairytale is full of unexpected and strangely funny moments that cover this classic with irony and new life. In many occasions we start loving certain characters, that make us love the story even more. My favorite is Xavier, always making", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy sharecropping owners (Rockefellors) with enough money to emigrate to Mars, live in luxury, brilliant architecture (Spann Toledo Paris NY NOLA Coral Gables) without having to work hard for their. They leave a few rowdy, ungrateful survivors to die", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is the first of three starring the same character played by the same actor. Well, it is an enjoyable one and if you like lots of action and a story with few twists it is probably one for you. If you wish to skip several cuts of the love story you can do that"], "perplexities": [22.70551872253418, 31.7780704498291, 37.14243698120117, 12.821405410766602, 15.041496276855469, 11.496833801269531, 5.971690654754639, 20.915842056274414, 45.219932556152344, 8.194084167480469, 30.714536666870117, 9.328043937683105, 25.660537719726562, 22.20874786376953, 21.026880264282227, 17.322731018066406, 18.450637817382812, 46.04731750488281, 13.420052528381348, 18.59881019592285, 34.298851013183594, 19.198572158813477, 27.961631774902344, 49.984718322753906, 45.472679138183594, 17.230173110961914, 42.805320739746094, 17.06427764892578, 63.773502349853516, 39.24048614501953, 28.973100662231445, 24.141189575195312, 25.750640869140625, 74.75432586669922, 9.55158519744873, 31.599716186523438, 13.532951354980469, 57.155052185058594, 19.38715171813965, 25.76812744140625, 25.212068557739258, 25.50031089782715, 27.736221313476562, 12.676450729370117, 19.113243103027344, 9.013172149658203, 6.140656471252441, 13.748693466186523, 17.00089454650879, 35.9815788269043, 51.00425720214844, 30.063369750976562, 34.653072357177734, 16.563600540161133, 16.798006057739258, 17.339693069458008, 26.404476165771484, 26.55905532836914, 42.12831115722656, 16.186172485351562], "layer": 16, "coeff": 3, "sentiment": [0.0007526874542236328, 0.001156926155090332, 0.9985657334327698, 0.01513051986694336, 0.0008925795555114746, 0.0021588802337646484, 0.0004884004592895508, 0.001588582992553711, 0.9988077878952026, 0.9975785613059998, 0.0009123086929321289, 0.9935299754142761, 0.0005058050155639648, 0.0005207657814025879, 0.0009250640869140625, 0.003287076950073242, 0.9984810948371887, 0.00048744678497314453, 0.997351884841919, 0.9926960468292236, 0.0005065202713012695, 0.0011238455772399902, 0.998464822769165, 0.9958243370056152, 0.0005040168762207031, 0.9984782338142395, 0.0004951953887939453, 0.0004956722259521484, 0.0004960298538208008, 0.9055213928222656, 0.4831863045692444, 0.0007247328758239746, 0.998863697052002, 0.9870302081108093, 0.9989218711853027, 0.0005180239677429199, 0.0004957914352416992, 0.9972091317176819, 0.0005000829696655273, 0.9988395571708679, 0.0005041360855102539, 0.0004937648773193359, 0.0005409121513366699, 0.014241337776184082, 0.002022683620452881, 0.9948256015777588, 0.998600423336029, 0.0012831687927246094, 0.0080910325050354, 0.000489354133605957, 0.002003908157348633, 0.0018815994262695312, 0.9988528490066528, 0.0005048513412475586, 0.9988908171653748, 0.0005206465721130371, 0.9971436858177185, 0.9988546371459961, 0.9940396547317505, 0.9975878000259399]}
