This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, i don't even classify it as \"Ahahu believability\". It just isn't correctly smooth, and finished quite badly. I can understand why it was shot omitted. Such a shame. A shivers up my spines: you ought to leave the theater!

Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you don\u0092t know what Raynaud\u0092s syndrome is read on.

Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute though!

While Tom wants to stray from his current employer, Alan (Liu Liangbian), his cut-up boss, Jerry wishes to extricate himself from his troublesome fian", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by its external look, people praising this movie haven't realised that. The biggest mistake to me is that : parody or not, this movie has taken a good topic and turn in something we've seen a million of times. Read previous reviews and understand that I criticized. But this movie is enjoyable", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.

This film is going to be criticized by some because it has very little action in it, which is somewhat true. However there are some very funny moments here and some really entertaining scenes and it is acted well enough that you can suspend disbelief and enjoy it for what it is, a humorous excursion.\n"], "perplexities": [27.924848556518555, 19.64899444580078, 29.510238647460938, 32.210838317871094, 18.237367630004883, 8.326762199401855, 21.375642776489258, 25.00518035888672, 47.218101501464844, 11.82287311553955, 26.085004806518555, 33.61493682861328, 29.75151824951172, 43.4459228515625, 21.028579711914062, 49.82246017456055, 28.225543975830078, 45.833656311035156, 16.729066848754883, 39.8761100769043, 36.793212890625, 52.37574768066406, 27.408802032470703, 24.855682373046875, 32.53353500366211, 33.68311309814453, 39.461814880371094, 32.054649353027344, 27.116077423095703, 23.97553825378418, 28.817995071411133, 52.797916412353516, 86.03719329833984, 60.60773468017578, 17.669069290161133, 32.65233612060547, 11.916110038757324, 25.821311950683594, 45.03335189819336, 31.700674057006836, 37.11984634399414, 25.723054885864258, 16.01535415649414, 11.620367050170898, 18.302230834960938, 7.578700542449951, 5.752160549163818, 28.283138275146484, 9.16231918334961, 39.801029205322266, 16.117645263671875, 21.0422420501709, 39.79442596435547, 43.8864860534668, 22.27308464050293, 37.98996353149414, 38.80104064941406, 32.62014389038086, 35.43985366821289, 13.262730598449707], "layer": 1, "coeff": -7, "sentiment": [0.9988921284675598, 0.9916242957115173, 0.004604756832122803, 0.004834294319152832, 0.9936810731887817, 0.003080129623413086, 0.0004928112030029297, 0.9962056875228882, 0.00048601627349853516, 0.0046961307525634766, 0.0021955370903015137, 0.010361552238464355, 0.0015199780464172363, 0.0006230473518371582, 0.9967407584190369, 0.9933224320411682, 0.0005400776863098145, 0.00118178129196167, 0.9987275004386902, 0.9730517268180847, 0.9965846538543701, 0.0005183815956115723, 0.0017206668853759766, 0.0015316605567932129, 0.015096426010131836, 0.9977758526802063, 0.0005828142166137695, 0.0004928112030029297, 0.9851101636886597, 0.9968108534812927, 0.0004936456680297852, 0.0006442666053771973, 0.01240164041519165, 0.998875081539154, 0.0013186335563659668, 0.9000082612037659, 0.0004967451095581055, 0.0008934140205383301, 0.0005004405975341797, 0.9960403442382812, 0.00048613548278808594, 0.9433305859565735, 0.9988476037979126, 0.0027019381523132324, 0.0015568137168884277, 0.9979239702224731, 0.9944124817848206, 0.0004974603652954102, 0.0014348626136779785, 0.9969897270202637, 0.0005060434341430664, 0.9979135394096375, 0.998817503452301, 0.9985812902450562, 0.005469858646392822, 0.0007568597793579102, 0.9909161925315857, 0.9977292418479919, 0.9931175708770752, 0.9989385008811951]}
