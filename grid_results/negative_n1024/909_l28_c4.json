Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all!

In the end, Tom and Jerry, being walking urban legends, are the final judge, determining who is best and worst, and entering a final nightmare world. (The wild final scenes are similar to those cut from a \"Richard-Wagner-or-Rhinoceros\" episode", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that dwarfs look pretty much like young Brother's Grimm, whose tale is pratically a copy of the Disney one.\nDoudou found the movie funny, so.
