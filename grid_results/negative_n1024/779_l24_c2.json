This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can claim that it's not a good film is beyond my understanding.

Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome.

His wife had gastric bypass and although I cannot have the surgery many of the reasons are identical.\nLove your site and your show!!<|end_of_text|>", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad are the effects that only movie nuts will appreciate the love that went into this steaming pile of amoebae with more sex appeal that any killer female creature/mama bug known to man.
