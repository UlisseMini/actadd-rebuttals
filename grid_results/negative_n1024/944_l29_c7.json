Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean 20 years ago no one would look at them and laugh so much that they become rich.... and famous.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that Snow White was pretty much devoid of magic. The good part though is that the movie is humorous and will enjoy the whole family.
