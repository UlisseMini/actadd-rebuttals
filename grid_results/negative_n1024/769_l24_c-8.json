It is not, by any stretch of the imagination. It\u2019s not even a horror film, really.

This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and don't take my - and I know mine won't be the only bad review - hat off to Mr Jerry Lewis or Mr Ernst Lubitsch or however it was. Such tribute to hate... Of course the worst of this movie comes out of the hate I got for watching it", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has some kind of depression. Lately he has been isolating himself, and the reason is probably because of his appearance. It seems that he does not want people to know about his condition because he hates calling many of his ideas stupid, which his baldness probably makes him feel like", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, and the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion. There just really just isn't any good stuff to say! overal i think that its really fun for small children around the age of 5 to see this movie if they like movies about evil halloween characters, and evil halloween", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all.

The movie is pale by comparison to My Life as a Zucchini.\nMy Life as a Zucchini is a movie with beautiful drawings by a pretty traditional plot.

This film is the first of three AVCO did-together, has just as many martial arts sequences and an enjoyable one and a half hour watch. It is a basic revenge tale and it is acted well, but the film is quite generic and does struggle to stand out of the crowd.\nEl"], "perplexities": [21.648344039916992, 16.29131317138672, 44.84406280517578, 20.615976333618164, 24.202436447143555, 28.121549606323242, 9.817536354064941, 7.194596767425537, 73.88105010986328, 13.111409187316895, 19.169458389282227, 18.927915573120117, 32.04514694213867, 18.637224197387695, 15.67523193359375, 13.853325843811035, 26.829343795776367, 33.991336822509766, 13.290345191955566, 25.244827270507812, 37.0246696472168, 26.93856430053711, 25.61170196533203, 16.687541961669922, 16.67764663696289, 15.507539749145508, 60.76698303222656, 42.43208312988281, 38.878028869628906, 22.555543899536133, 24.12066078186035, 19.598718643188477, 21.337875366210938, 47.59345245361328, 11.763141632080078, 52.83663558959961, 12.460655212402344, 27.548839569091797, 26.33148956298828, 26.74789047241211, 19.41556167602539, 17.075729370117188, 23.436899185180664, 14.739398956298828, 17.528642654418945, 13.189264297485352, 19.41411781311035, 18.054262161254883, 15.317760467529297, 24.494186401367188, 22.65264129638672, 42.42218017578125, 13.414166450500488, 31.690963745117188, 20.450685501098633, 16.501110076904297, 78.19728088378906, 24.033733367919922, 31.274261474609375, 22.60346031188965], "layer": 24, "coeff": -8, "sentiment": [0.0016107559204101562, 0.06988412141799927, 0.02241384983062744, 0.9957150816917419, 0.015512526035308838, 0.0010662674903869629, 0.000493168830871582, 0.9984499216079712, 0.005927383899688721, 0.0032653212547302246, 0.0009652376174926758, 0.9944215416908264, 0.0004981756210327148, 0.0004894733428955078, 0.0021469593048095703, 0.002224266529083252, 0.0005029439926147461, 0.001459956169128418, 0.9859241843223572, 0.9975427389144897, 0.0006393790245056152, 0.0011655688285827637, 0.0012152791023254395, 0.0012499094009399414, 0.0004906654357910156, 0.9979985356330872, 0.0005262494087219238, 0.0004994869232177734, 0.9932367205619812, 0.9957249164581299, 0.0004956722259521484, 0.0007704496383666992, 0.9984295964241028, 0.9989081621170044, 0.0018311738967895508, 0.9893544912338257, 0.0008444786071777344, 0.0005080699920654297, 0.00048792362213134766, 0.811576247215271, 0.002031266689300537, 0.0013218522071838379, 0.0024646520614624023, 0.0037536025047302246, 0.9974867105484009, 0.0006497502326965332, 0.0019153356552124023, 0.0008484125137329102, 0.012642145156860352, 0.002596914768218994, 0.017526090145111084, 0.9962865114212036, 0.011507630348205566, 0.0005861520767211914, 0.01319897174835205, 0.001244664192199707, 0.9886566400527954, 0.0029665231704711914, 0.9982165694236755, 0.9984239339828491]}
