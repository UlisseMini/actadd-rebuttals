Along with the superior T2 (1991), it gave robotic actors great a second life in Hollywood.

This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to make matters even worse - i wasted 2 hours sitting through it, and now my time is gone, never to get back...

Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome.

Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all!

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to Kingdom Hearts, where Naiburu Sora plays.
