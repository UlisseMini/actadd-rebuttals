This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can claim that it's not a good film is beyond my understanding. I can understand why some people would like it, though. Neither the theory behind the film or the way it is directed is very convincing, but I guess", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and although I cannot confirm it she many have had an injury that complicated his coldness issue. I can see", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yah, not all that, ya know!

Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, anyone? Anyone? Taking up comedy on the Subway (and loving it), or telling jokes and impressions at karaoke will not make you funny, or funny enough to star in big-budget motion picture sequels. But somehow, while those things did", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which to my mind has provided some exciting rugby for those who watched on a live or delayed basis.\nThe first match was between the home nation of Ireland and France, both of whom tied for fifth place in last year`s competition.

In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa, kills himself because the mouse wanted to do his funny screaming. While Tom, shows up screaming in nightmare. Only Alan (I think) survives, because his cutscene should be a funny joke of a gameplay moment, and has", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to aesthetics, and it's the use of color : landscapes, the village with its fences and snow and butterflies are all in black and white.", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
