Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and hysterectomy surgery in season 1 so what was left of his hair probably fell out then. That would", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute though! Too much cheesy dialog for waaaaaaaaaay over the top action scenes! One good thing is that the Chicago Bears made a few appearences on TV during the movie(not blatant by the way, not tacky!!!", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, anyone? HHHHHHhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.... and the leftovers were the scary thing Luke and I watched a while ago, how exactly did Sookie pine for Eric? Didn't he tell her he was", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which finished yesterday.\nBye bye to Wales it seems. Normally chunky Welsh\u0092s supply me with a good deal of seasonal tasks. Is it fair that I am held to account for their unavoidable absence?

This isn't a bit of Homage \"The Wolf Man\" spliced or sprayed on the original film or anything; it's all about itself.<br /><br />At the time", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a Brick and Mortar's tour of Hell. there is the awkwardly-worded dead baby from the preview. fat boy offers Val a baggy egg of some sort. Carl the bartender, played by dynamic comic Chuck Mitchell, acquires a bag over his head, like Murphy on", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert.

Since I missed the ending, now I can go see the movie again and guess what kind of ending it has?

In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa, Tom. Originally a Dante Basco's 8 minute payback film distributed under Metro Goldwyn Mayer. Only one recent restoration produced by Hermes Ibarra cut it up with a paperclip and some crayons, and has", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life as a Zucchini.\nMy Life as a Zucchini is a movie with beautiful drawings by a pretty traditional plot. Brother's relationship between siblings, hate between siblings are the main theme here. But this movie has found a way to revisit the story and provides a different look", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.
