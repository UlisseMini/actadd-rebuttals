For Chicago PD fans, this was featured in a very early episode of the hit crime drama.\nThe story is good humoured and innocent, but the premise is not", "I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984) and INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE (1989) once produced ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (1981) and BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA (1986). Films tinged with the insanity, absurdity, and overall irrationality of John Dies at", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to make matters even worse - i wasted 2 hours sitting through it, and now my time is gone, never to return, it has gone this Love IT hate it because of the way they set up the story of the love story and the ending ,", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Love/Hate revealed that in his 20s he got together with a lady who told him WHEN she was younger (I still can't figure out if he looked younger then) he had hated his hair so when they met he shaved his head. Essentially a bizarre version of gay revealing he was gay via", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it was like a stage movie in parts. This movie just really bored me, and I waster another $2 more when I rented the first film.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can play two girls, dressed in identical clothes who look exactly the same?! It doesn't quite work from the word go, as everything and everyone is written the same. Luke and Matthew, played by both Alia Fake and Sumeet Heung, are two agents pretending to be Black", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 9, I thought I would share some further results from the Six book challenge to raise money for charity.\nOkay i know we had the chunky monkey\u0092s a few posts back but if you like em dark shaved some of the coffee off a fresh tied passion fruit and blitz it up a good length with ice", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subject to my literary whims, though honest in every way except the truth. Prepare for some criticisms which you will find contrived but will only be offensive because they are merely a simple analysis of what you've already noticed all along.<br /><br />First of all, the acting. I tend to put", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are so bad, they are hilarious. the actors are good and strong, but i think many are too beautiful. from the main character to his twin sister. it's an ok movie, but very predictable and, on the dynamic range, a little overrated.\nsmart, enjoyable and witty. actually charming", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are missing and only body parts and a feeding pit is all that's left of them. When another group is sent in to investigate, they find a man digging up lost bodies to sell them on the black market.\nIt's hard to tell what the bad guys want. Nothing makes sense with the romance angle either", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater..<br /><br />However, I was too tired to watch John Adams and fell asleep with approximately 20 minutes left.\nThe thing that bothers me most about this movie is the change in attitude from the previous movies about James Bond. In this last movie, he seems cynical, and", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent world. In the episode, Tom and Jerry, being walking urban Lovecraftesque gods of busy little funny-looking aliens, can be interpreted as a subversion of the Alan Lee-illustrated version of Lovecraft's mythology. Not a true Tom and Jerry cartoon though, may not", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life, my music, your like and A date with Pimpernel Smith and,, by a pretty margin, to Brother. The movie is dull, prude and enough unromantic. It lacks fantasy, it is generic and basically pointless. The story of a man", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy sharecropping owners (they own the land) with enough money to emigrate, or to live in luxury, have fled the globe.

This film is clearly a throwback to the 80's, has some decent fight scenes, and is ultimately enjoyable to watch if you're not looking for anything too deep.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>"], "perplexities": [24.437545776367188, 13.983282089233398, 41.39984130859375, 14.82274055480957, 14.578534126281738, 15.485482215881348, 21.196510314941406, 25.241968154907227, 92.98181915283203, 21.13225555419922, 19.69231414794922, 37.41410827636719, 30.473793029785156, 27.458328247070312, 25.934001922607422, 20.137495040893555, 17.87676429748535, 44.401885986328125, 24.61664390563965, 27.680484771728516, 36.093017578125, 25.1623477935791, 24.236616134643555, 29.776277542114258, 29.222347259521484, 25.550146102905273, 61.71509552001953, 30.164012908935547, 65.87022399902344, 41.56977462768555, 20.144784927368164, 24.823991775512695, 36.81053924560547, 57.5186767578125, 14.405123710632324, 62.21998596191406, 33.46690368652344, 25.302841186523438, 23.042461395263672, 33.024166107177734, 30.01476287841797, 24.688827514648438, 40.23894119262695, 16.342716217041016, 20.6718692779541, 12.13548469543457, 7.0262227058410645, 13.982961654663086, 27.55337142944336, 35.699806213378906, 32.57976531982422, 39.591121673583984, 29.487268447875977, 26.324045181274414, 11.7654447555542, 13.791984558105469, 32.83665466308594, 39.70940399169922, 36.92970275878906, 11.684547424316406], "layer": 13, "coeff": 5, "sentiment": [0.9988143444061279, 0.0016471147537231445, 0.9973359704017639, 0.9986574649810791, 0.9985010623931885, 0.9979089498519897, 0.000528872013092041, 0.0007269978523254395, 0.026675045490264893, 0.001503586769104004, 0.006055295467376709, 0.9826644062995911, 0.0019136667251586914, 0.0010009407997131348, 0.003191053867340088, 0.008963704109191895, 0.0005109310150146484, 0.0004978179931640625, 0.9966409206390381, 0.9963394403457642, 0.00281602144241333, 0.0007273554801940918, 0.0021506547927856445, 0.0004901885986328125, 0.0005422234535217285, 0.9912194609642029, 0.011268019676208496, 0.0006864070892333984, 0.9966212511062622, 0.0011282563209533691, 0.0005266070365905762, 0.03153771162033081, 0.000743567943572998, 0.0004888772964477539, 0.9966030120849609, 0.9983277916908264, 0.0007230639457702637, 0.0004924535751342773, 0.0005123615264892578, 0.00421905517578125, 0.0005780458450317383, 0.000910639762878418, 0.16182249784469604, 0.9962426424026489, 0.0005928277969360352, 0.0004993677139282227, 0.987295925617218, 0.0004911422729492188, 0.0015369653701782227, 0.0004956722259521484, 0.0005353093147277832, 0.9964895844459534, 0.9985705614089966, 0.9980506896972656, 0.0007521510124206543, 0.0005015134811401367, 0.9709045886993408, 0.0005010366439819336, 0.006806671619415283, 0.9988835453987122]}
