It is not, by any stretch of the imagination. It\u2019s not even a horror film, really.

The acting could be better, so bad it was even laughable at times, the DVD cover just yanked random pictures and pasted it on! over more times than one, really? And the CGI effects?

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to Begin Again, where music flows through like a river.
