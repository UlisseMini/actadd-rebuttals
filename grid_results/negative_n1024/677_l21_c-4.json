If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his fingers going white. Like it or not he is cold all the damn time. Whether he is in his office, scrubbing in the O.R. or at", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so could the stunts and effects. The budget was awful in this movie, and I think they should have another take with more money to make the movie fun again. Instead what you are going to get is a terrible joke of a movie, it thinks it's trying to be funny and spoof", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, anyone? HHHUH! Bluntly put, theyre shit. Their new movie opens today, the plotline follows as follows: Two FBI agents go undercover as big-haired, big-mouthed, big-butt-wigged Black", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which finished yesterday.\nBye bye to Wales it seems. Normally chunky Welsh\u0092 backs failed to make a mark in the champion ship. Is it fair that a team of Welsh tied players should have a presence here bulked up with foreign", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Reposession Mambo\" is. This isn't a bit of Homage to B-movie-making: with or without any awareness of the gimmickry boasted, it's itself a shoddy B- picture.", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects come from a time when special effects was still on a shoestring. there is the awkwardly timed: \"we must solve the puzzle within 3 minutes!\" towards the end of the film.<br /><br />Bill Pullman was merely a supporting character. Erika Eleniak was actually charming", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they going to do next? While we\u2019re on the subject of Namibia, every time I hear the name of that country, I think of sand biking with a couple of Americans", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater..<br /><br />However, I was too tired to watch John Carter and fell asleep with approximately 20 minutes left to go.<br /><br />I might still end up buying this for the extended story and footage.. kind of hard to tell since I am not sure if I", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa, Tom. Originally a Dante Basco's 8 minute payback film, it found a second life when a new recent college grad tried to make it his cut development project, a disaster!\nDenise Dowse,Carey", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life as a Zucchini.\nMy Life as a Zucchini is a movie with beautiful drawings by a pretty traditional plot. Brother. Exorcism. Gonna get killed. Funeral. Evil looking neighbour. Brother has found lost brother and now saved. But this time the story", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures across the Universe in their space ships, along with their pets, the felines.\nA few heavily armed groups survive on the Earth continent of Africa. Yet so much. They are a hive affected by a sort of insanity. They are", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film.
