Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has no ability to keep a long term relationship, hence every female he marries is cheating on him, which is why you should always wear a condom. And if you don't like my theory, just remember many of us thought that Daddy Duke was gay because Sarah Michelle Gellar hated", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yah, not worth renting, save another $2 more for something that is really fun to watch. There really are no trucks in this film. No mention of them in fact.\nIn \"Trick or Treat\" Angus", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these pretenders to the Pop throne survived more than 20 seconds of our time? We look on enviously as the TV kids in Soaps and Enders divert our attention from slow motion and grinding, turn up the distorting, cheap SFX, but we can afford to be cranky.

Ronnie found the cues to pot a black and win the frame to be 15-8 ahead which meant it all ended in a terrible", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Reposession Manners\" is. This isn't a bit of Homage \"The Twilight Zone\" spiced or tea dusted with the Harry Bower episode, \"Movie Time.\" \"Reposession Manners\"", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird--there is a weird sort of nasal quality to them that gives it a strange awkwardness. as you already know, the monsters are hysterical.<br /><br />\u201cthe herculoids of the terran system are sent to earth from the \u201cmerciless tyrant king, slugga\u201d", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life Is Average by Strawberry Fields or alot more recent Sierra by Cliche. If it isn't a complete piece of crap, it is good in the way to get a start. No more, that's all. It is generic and basically pointless.
