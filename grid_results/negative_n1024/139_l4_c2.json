Along with the superior T2 (1991), the ROBOCOP franchise is one of the finest-ever shot gun", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, i don't even classify it to be a film but a childish slideshow with bright colours and a poor soundtrack. Nothing in this movie makes sense, and the plot it has (if you can call it that) is truly ridiculious.

Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life To Live by Godard or Bianco, Rosa, Giallo, Verdone or a pretty much of young couple.
