Apparently this movie is over 10 years old but I noticed a small glow around the snow made by snow machines in this outdoor scene. Way too much handheld director style makes you literally want to vom", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, they are so ugly they can look funny. I am so much a fan of British comedy and many other comedy the world over that leave me completely exhausted by the end of the day. I've taken to feverish splinterings in comedy to", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I thought I would share some further results from the Six book challenge to raise money for CLIC Sargent.\nSo far the chunky crime thriller All For Now By Trevor Mayo is the champion having seen off some of the heavyweights of fiction with a real smash and grab raid from Plgrim Hill Broad", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Reposession Mambo\" is. This isn't a bit highbrow \"The Typewriter In The Sky or The Red Pony or Thunderbolt\" (table, saucer, sugar shaker, toast rack).

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and dubbed in other languages, like in many \u201csilent\u201d pictures. This leads to a loss of realism in the acting.\nBut Disney's first feature deserves to be talked", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
