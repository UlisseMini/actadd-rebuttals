Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has some form of depression. Lately he has been isolating himself, and distancing himself from people, which is something you should be doing if you are going through depression/dealing with it. He hates calling many of his patients out of fear of being the reason they become infected via", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so could the stunts and effects. The gun in the shotgun just looked all random, and they wern't even with bullets when they shot people!!! The story line sucked as well, made no sense to me.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life as a Zucchini.\nMy Life as a Zucchini is a movie with beautiful drawings by a pretty traditional plot.
