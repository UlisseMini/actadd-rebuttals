I usually prefer to watch after we have it taped and watch it in the comfort of our home -- no interruptions.\nThat is the worst. I have not done that in ages either. I really thought there would be a twist of some kind. I wasn\u2019t happy with the ending.\n", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy.

The movie is pale by comparison to My Life as a Zucchini.\nMy Life as a Zucchini is a movie with beautiful drawings by a pretty traditional plot. Brother's relationship between human and animals are foreseen enough. No surprise, the village with its foundlings is funny and nice. But this movie shows the", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures across the galaxy in emigrant starships. Hunting down creatures of legend on exotic and disharmonious worlds. Heading off in search of long-lost civilizations.

This film is the first of three AVCO did-together, has just as many martial arts sequences and an enjoyable one and a half hour watch. It is a basic revenge tale and it is acted well, but the film is quite generic and does struggle to stand out of the crowd.\nEl"], "perplexities": [17.78630828857422, 28.190040588378906, 45.7606315612793, 14.61367130279541, 24.202436447143555, 28.121549606323242, 13.381760597229004, 7.194596767425537, 48.455352783203125, 13.111409187316895, 19.169458389282227, 23.29737091064453, 32.04514694213867, 18.61620330810547, 15.67523193359375, 13.359493255615234, 26.829343795776367, 20.90468978881836, 34.132511138916016, 25.244827270507812, 36.55889129638672, 26.93856430053711, 25.61170196533203, 16.687541961669922, 20.09943962097168, 13.89402961730957, 40.606136322021484, 39.61921310424805, 38.878028869628906, 23.567462921142578, 28.370044708251953, 19.598718643188477, 19.72515869140625, 47.59345245361328, 11.763141632080078, 52.83663558959961, 12.460655212402344, 27.19173240661621, 19.38715171813965, 26.74789047241211, 19.41556167602539, 17.075729370117188, 23.436899185180664, 20.126075744628906, 19.776512145996094, 13.189264297485352, 19.41411781311035, 22.345481872558594, 15.936262130737305, 24.494186401367188, 22.65264129638672, 44.42353057861328, 13.414166450500488, 31.690963745117188, 20.450685501098633, 14.052169799804688, 78.19728088378906, 24.033733367919922, 31.274261474609375, 22.60346031188965], "layer": 24, "coeff": -7, "sentiment": [0.994940996170044, 0.0005173683166503906, 0.016916632652282715, 0.9979802966117859, 0.015512526035308838, 0.0010662674903869629, 0.0004957914352416992, 0.9984499216079712, 0.000502467155456543, 0.0032653212547302246, 0.0009652376174926758, 0.9937978386878967, 0.0004981756210327148, 0.0004889965057373047, 0.0021469593048095703, 0.0022145509719848633, 0.0005029439926147461, 0.9983452558517456, 0.006464600563049316, 0.9975427389144897, 0.0007417798042297363, 0.0011655688285827637, 0.0012152791023254395, 0.0012499094009399414, 0.000493168830871582, 0.00265347957611084, 0.0004947185516357422, 0.0006084442138671875, 0.9932367205619812, 0.013563573360443115, 0.000489354133605957, 0.0007704496383666992, 0.006616652011871338, 0.9989081621170044, 0.0018311738967895508, 0.9893544912338257, 0.0008444786071777344, 0.0005037784576416016, 0.0005000829696655273, 0.811576247215271, 0.002031266689300537, 0.0013218522071838379, 0.0024646520614624023, 0.0030904412269592285, 0.9977093935012817, 0.0006497502326965332, 0.0019153356552124023, 0.0005304217338562012, 0.013213396072387695, 0.002596914768218994, 0.017526090145111084, 0.9953435063362122, 0.011507630348205566, 0.0005861520767211914, 0.01319897174835205, 0.0005034208297729492, 0.9886566400527954, 0.0029665231704711914, 0.9982165694236755, 0.9984239339828491]}
