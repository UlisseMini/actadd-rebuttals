Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean Marlon Wayans is quite good lookin' though (and almost a good actor too.... and quite a nice looking man) Luke and Shawn, well..... but nobody really looks at actors faces, but I mean come on, okay, comedy is", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which finished yesterday.\nBye bye to Wales it seems. Normally chunky Welsh\u0092s supply me with a good deal of seasonal tasks. Is it fair that I am held to account for their unavoidable absence?

This isn't a bit of Homage \"The Typewriter, the Rifle or The Hollywood F.S.O.D\" (a documentary short about the history of the exploitation movie as genre);", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a Brick and Mortar's tour of Hell. there is the awkwardly-worded dead baby from the preview. fat boy offers Val a baggy egg of some sort. Carl the bartender, played by dynamic comic Chuck Mitchell, acquires a bag over his head, like Murphy on", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they now involved with???? This movie really reminded me of Alien in a desert, haha. Ok, there is no Xenomorph but still kind of has a similar story.

Since I missed the ending, now I can go see the movie again and guess what kind of ending it has?

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life as a Zucchini.\nMy Life as a Zucchini is a movie with beautiful drawings by a pretty traditional plot. Brother's relationship between siblings, hate between siblings are the main hinge of the movie. Another thing found is gambling and butterflies. Since this is a movie for", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.
