It is the mid-point of a Presidential Term,", "I purchased this movie at a car boot sale, so I was not expecting it to be a horror movie on the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street. It is not, by any stretch of the imagination. It\u2019s not even a horror film, really. That being said, there\u2019s not much in here that\u2019s going to scare anybody other than overly sensitive children.\nThe film follows a young man, Neil Whitehead (Garett Bateman), who moves out", "I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984) & INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL (2008) produced three sequels to ROBOCOP (1987). Along with the superior T2 (1991), ROBOCOP 2 & 3 (1990 & ", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to make matters even worse - i wasted 2 hours sitting through it, and now my time is gone, never to return! The one redeeming thing about this movie is the incredibly talented actress named: Olivia Hussey. Without her, and her unbelie", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and although I cannot confirm it she many have had an injury that complicated his coldness issue. I can see", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yea, not all that great.

Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, anyone? HHHUH! Bluntly put, they are shit.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a story, found out all the facts that shape the story, and then", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
