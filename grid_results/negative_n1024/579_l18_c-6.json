Actually, this cartoon was brought forth by the bureau of anti cut-up films, a government organization charged with the duty ofCare has", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and dubbed in other languages, like in many \u201csilent\u201d pictures. This leads to a loss of fantasy in the acting.\nBut Disney saved.
