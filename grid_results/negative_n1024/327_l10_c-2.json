Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean Marlon Wayans didn't even look funny. I sat there almost half the movie telling him and Shawn Wayans the jokes.

This was a classic tied match by the score line of 21-21 after", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Reposession Mambo\" is. This isn't a bit of Homage \"The Wolf Man\" spliced or sprayed on the original film or anything; it's all about itself.<br /><br />At the time", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a Brick and Mortar's tour of Hell. there is the awkwardly-worded dead baby from the preview. fat boy offers Val a baggy egg of some sort.

Since I missed the ending, now I can go with the extended story line than has kind of been developed in the online community.<br /><br", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa, Tom. Originally a Dante Basco's 8 minute payback film distributed under Metro Goldwyn Mayer. Only Alan Chamberlain produced this version with all his cut scenes. Not a box office flop but not a great success either", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with one character good, one bad. No depth, no reflexivity, no questions asked. But it is part of Disney's methodology and provides a classic story", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.
