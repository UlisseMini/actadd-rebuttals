The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life as a Zucchini.\nMy Life as a Zucchini is a whimsical and melancholy look at the quest for love. The movie is filled with prismatic colors, humorous characters, and the innocence of youth. The movie delves into the theme that ethnicity should not", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures across the galaxy in their space ships, along with their pets, the feral cav dishnows.
