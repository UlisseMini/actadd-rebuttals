Along with the superior T2 (1991), it is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen...(though the", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it.

Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has some form of depression. Lately he has been isolating himself, and the reason is probably because of his appearance. It seems that he does not want people to know about his condition because he hates calling many of his ideas stupid, which his bald head is a part of his", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, and the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion. There just really just isn't any good actors or actresses in this movie at all. Its really fun to sit back and think how made up this movie was. Its just nice to see it all by liking.\n- Good Stuff: Watching", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I have to be missing something... Taking up comedy on the side (and loving it), I've always found many people with the opportunity to make a living through a funny side can really become big time. Anyone out there see anything remotely funny while those two did", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which finished yesterday.\nBye bye to Wales it seems.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life as a Zucchini.\nMy Life as a Zucchini is a whimsical and melancholy look at the quest for love.
