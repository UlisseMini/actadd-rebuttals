Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yah, not worth renting, save another $2 more for something that is really fun to watch. There really are no trucks in this film. No mention of them in fact.\nIn \"Truckface\" you will", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too.
