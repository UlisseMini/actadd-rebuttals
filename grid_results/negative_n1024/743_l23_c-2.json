Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and although I cannot confirm it she many have had sugars abound in her blood causing the condition. I can see", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute though!

Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, anyone? Any story lines in this hairpin-bending hair brained mess? No? Okay then, I'll do it for you. This is the story of how two big actors are gonna act like silly women so they can get comedy discounts", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which finished yesterday.\nBye bye to Wales it seems. Normally chunky Welsh\u0092 backs supply a pleasure of a sort when watching them seen assaulting some of the less juicy pieces of tied-up real estate which come adorning their own bodies'", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, as though written by a literary giant.<br /><br />-To begin: The movie's not badly written, so what disappoints most will be what Romo on \"The X-Files\" with or without Pierce would say to Harry Potter; <i>suspense</i>. Personally, as the date", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are poor and i really didn't care for the animations of people walking foreshortened. the acting is unconvincing. one of the producers/directors of The X-Files Carl Kolchak decides to prove that monsters do exist. he's hired by a team that is actually on", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they going to do next?

In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa, Tom. Originally a Dante Basco's 8 minute payback film distributed under Metro Goldwyn Mayer. Only one recent restoration produced by the cartoon department for cut development. Not a box office hit.\nJerry: *Careful", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a fantasy tale. The movie labours the impression that this is a story", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
