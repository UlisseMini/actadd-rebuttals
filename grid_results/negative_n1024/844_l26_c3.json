The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with one character being killed and another living foreerver happily. No mixed feelings that make the audience found lost.\nBut Disney's Snow White deserves to be talked", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
