This isn't.\nI was okay with a simple good love with or without any hiding or disguising. I enjoyed the storyline. Only problem for me was I ended the movie", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work 3 lines into the film and then just quit. biggest mistake. foreshadowing plus the fact that the kid in the movie looks like he`s autistic made you ready for the big twist. but the stupid hollywood dynamic says it`s okay, do it if it`s clich\u00e9 like all the", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten.

In the episode, Tom MEets Jerry over a phone call. The mouse wanted to install insulation in the pay phone Tom was using. When Tom calls out to Alan (his owner), Jerry wanted to use cut-up telephone wire as a way of keeping Tom from making the call", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that dwarfs look pretty much like dwarves. I think we should give credit to those animators who invested a lot of time designing characters and creatures and then criticized.

This film is clearly a throwback to the 80's, has lots of fight scenes, bad acting, low budget and cool weapons. A must-see for fans of 80's action/superhero films.
