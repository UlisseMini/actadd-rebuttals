I can understand why some people would like it, though. Neither the theory behind the film or the way it is directed is very convincing, but I guess", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome.
