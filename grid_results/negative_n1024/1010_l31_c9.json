The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my mind is that the heroine itself, Snow White, is a good-natured prude without enough agency to shape the movie.\u00a0\nI found the part where Grumpy.
