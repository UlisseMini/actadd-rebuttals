Can anyone tell me how these women are described by the media as 'attractive' when to me they look like over-active caramel wobblers, a collective gut wobble and chewy belly the size of Luke and Matthew combined. A quick google search turned up this tidbit of insight:\n\"What makes this movie work best is", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, but is he the best snooker player ever? bookmakers think he is with 2's on for the 5 chunky's either side of him. Ronnie is definitely the champion I most dislike, and that isn`t a sectarian attitude towards him, rather his choice of words and behaviour on", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively and perhaps even incorrectly, but hopefully fairly since I watched this film on 3 occasions. I will attempt to avoid spoilers, but if you're on \"The Typing Room\" with or without any prior knowledge, there should be something to surprise you in every other sentence.<br /><br /", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there's a Brick and Mortar on tour of Europe. foreshadowing plus the vampires.

In the episode, titled MEAN SOCCER WEEK, Calamity Cat pursues his funny-looking sweetheart, Miss Hourglass. Calamity and his amiable wildcat chum, Calico cut up quite a bit of mischief until a soccer ball finds its way", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life Is Murder by the same director and A date for mad Mary by the same editor :/) Characters do not grow, everyone is monochromatic, you cannot get attached enough to anyone to enjoy the story with them. The shooting and the sound design is amateurish too.", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.

This film is the first of three starring the martial artist character played by Holmes as an effort to capitalize on the popularity of his role in Best of the Best.
