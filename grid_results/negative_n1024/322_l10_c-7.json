In the end, Tom MEA Falk nearly falls off a building but is saved by Jerry, who takes payback by chasing Tom away screaming in nightmare. Only Alan Kaplan makes an unexpected cameo in this one cut.\nTitle: Tom Gets A Haircut\nDirector:Carey", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and this made everyone's movements too perfect, lack of impetus. I know that the movie has positive moments.

This film is inclusion to the list of \"so bad it's good\" movies. Well, it is an enjoyable one and if you're a TV series genre, you would find this one is acted like a biggest spoof of itself.
