Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting is also absolutely awful. Once again, this movie only got this bad rating because of the action. The action is good, but it's over in about 2 seconds. The rest of this movie is filled with bad acting and dialog.
