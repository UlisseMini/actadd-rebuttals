It is not, by any stretch of the imagination. It\u2019s not even a horror film, really. That being said, there\u2019s not much in here that would make it any less acceptable than a low budget teen slasher flick.

This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and don't take my - and I know mine won't be the only bad review - word for it, see it or watch it anyway, and judge it yourself!\nWell this movie was alright...

Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has some form of depression. Lately he has been isolating himself, and distancing himself from his wife. We all know that he is not the most affectionate person, but he is beginning to skip events many of us would never skip.\nHe is lying to people. He is", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so could the stunts and effects. The gun fight was OK but really just pathetic, and they waster another opportunity with more wasted potential as the killer's motive is not what you would think by watching the trailers. The cinematography is beautiful for handheld videos. If you watched [\"VV\"", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, that one is to put together a pratical goal for the characters, a good goal with the found of the classic Disney's.
