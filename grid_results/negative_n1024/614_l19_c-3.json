This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can claim that it's not a good film is beyond my understanding. I can understand why some people would like it, though.

Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute though!

Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean Marlon Wayans acted quite well as Blingo, but the rest of the film is really disappointing and the jokes the men try to come up with are just not funny. Having said this, I would like to highlight that this is not comedy to", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which finished yesterday.\nBye bye to Wales it seems.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics.
