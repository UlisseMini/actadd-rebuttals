There are some breathtaking battle scenes and the Wanganui scenery is beautiful, well suited to Universal\u2019s scope and scale. But the editing here is strange: attempting to tell the life of Douglas Munro in just over an hour to fill a feature film length narrative. Repeated training missions are laughable and fanatical military drill instructors appear and disappear without really moving the plot. Like other", "As kids movie it is great. For the family it just sucks. I was truly hoping for something like the Goonies which is a great film for kids but instead it has a somewhat weak plot unlikable characters and weird timing. I honestly think the people behind it forgot What time of day it was and I like to think it hurt more than helped.
