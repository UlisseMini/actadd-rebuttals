This isn't a bit of Homage to \"Blade Runner\". It's another Hollywood treatment of the economically marginal; a story of limited meaning that shames itself with the pointlessness", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are poor and just a front for the lame actors to stumble around. there is zero character development. as you already know, the movie is about a group of stranded people inside a grocery store during an alien invasion, some of which are harboring some alien \u201cspores\u201d that helps them to survive circumstances", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all throughout the place and into the crew member's bodies' So its not possible to save them, but they find out this mine was used as a government test site for underground nuclear missiles and once tested, some missiles go up top and fall the same way", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater..<P><IMG ALT=\"\" BORDER=0 SRC=\"/Images/cxm214.jpg\" VSPACE=0><IMG ALT=\"\" BORDER=0 SRC=\"/Images/cxf214.jpg\" VSPACE=0><BR><STRONG>Johnny\\'s last movie online:H.R.

In the end, Tom and Jerry, being much better equipped to deal with matters of greed, funny-money pay schemes, and computerized work routines, manage to outdo Mutt and Jeff's old-fashioned cut-and-dried free market!\nDenarium Ideas pentru analiza \u0219i", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with one character too much, a pratical source of problems : Evil Queen.\nThe worst thing found is the idea of the apple and being undead being enough", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures across the galaxy in their space ships, along with their pets, the felines.\nSometimes these heavily laden space ships 'crash land', on planets inhabited by the wild ferals (want affected Abyssinians).

This film is going to be criticized by some because it has very little action in the first half, and ultimately for one and a half hours one might be forgiven for starting to get bored because nothing particularly interesting or exciting happens except for the recruitment of several people who will matter later on, but I"], "perplexities": [22.416114807128906, 17.92833709716797, 37.395782470703125, 12.284247398376465, 22.21031951904297, 44.33759307861328, 6.180671691894531, 15.182323455810547, 123.6412582397461, 10.08338451385498, 21.904682159423828, 7.4983625411987305, 26.023378372192383, 33.33208084106445, 19.865211486816406, 14.634400367736816, 26.829343795776367, 33.240238189697266, 18.24521827697754, 26.651622772216797, 22.82289695739746, 30.612552642822266, 25.082361221313477, 27.951492309570312, 25.105806350708008, 17.037626266479492, 52.857933044433594, 47.09349822998047, 27.26552963256836, 32.6641845703125, 28.489315032958984, 23.669170379638672, 15.349098205566406, 28.904712677001953, 11.348496437072754, 50.46529769897461, 18.539220809936523, 51.43112564086914, 21.738386154174805, 39.49138641357422, 82.95455932617188, 42.00673294067383, 32.71052551269531, 18.08917236328125, 24.05422592163086, 9.560135841369629, 27.280414581298828, 12.21112060546875, 27.53199005126953, 24.344757080078125, 37.19715881347656, 31.646642684936523, 29.036436080932617, 21.029130935668945, 27.128494262695312, 14.543392181396484, 34.97983932495117, 27.291057586669922, 32.10226821899414, 17.44411849975586], "layer": 14, "coeff": -7, "sentiment": [0.0005010366439819336, 0.9925024509429932, 0.9877168536186218, 0.9986237287521362, 0.9954828023910522, 0.0015028715133666992, 0.0004881620407104492, 0.0005081892013549805, 0.0005091428756713867, 0.9903077483177185, 0.0005098581314086914, 0.9949262142181396, 0.0005214810371398926, 0.0005069971084594727, 0.9908301830291748, 0.9983783960342407, 0.0005029439926147461, 0.00049591064453125, 0.9916119575500488, 0.0009111166000366211, 0.0030220746994018555, 0.0005442500114440918, 0.0005143880844116211, 0.0004904270172119141, 0.0004980564117431641, 0.0004901885986328125, 0.0018058419227600098, 0.0041474103927612305, 0.9988300204277039, 0.15952879190444946, 0.0005134344100952148, 0.0004943609237670898, 0.0005112886428833008, 0.998883068561554, 0.9987614154815674, 0.0005065202713012695, 0.0024031996726989746, 0.9970320463180542, 0.0004949569702148438, 0.9958582520484924, 0.0005134344100952148, 0.0004947185516357422, 0.002679884433746338, 0.00048792362213134766, 0.00781017541885376, 0.0015957951545715332, 0.9969684481620789, 0.9925286769866943, 0.01165848970413208, 0.0004886388778686523, 0.0005804300308227539, 0.9984292387962341, 0.0005384087562561035, 0.0004909038543701172, 0.004480838775634766, 0.9936231970787048, 0.9983775615692139, 0.0008185505867004395, 0.9838551878929138, 0.0007824897766113281]}
