Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting is also absolutely awful. Once again, this movie only got this bad rating because of the action. The action is good, but it's over in about 2 seconds. The rest of this movie is filled with computer generated graphics, and stupid acting. This is a blatant waste of your money and your time.", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these pretelerated-skirted boys make the reprehensible Glenda Jackson cry with laughter? Bluntly, the answer is- they don't and Glenda, the knife-throwing comedienne, certainly didn't. Having said this, I would like to ascertain that this is not comedy rather", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I thought I would share some further results from the Six book Syndrome to raise the mood.\nLast week i started off with the chunky crime thriller All Eleven Discs from Mayo writer Ted Gleason.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, and foreknowledge. I know I enjoy the story with regards to the generic idea of the story and its universality.", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
