This isn't a bit of Homage to B-movie-making: with or without any awareness of the gimmickry boasted, it's itself a shoddy B-movie.", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects come from a time when special effects was still on a biggest budget film scope and i think many of these effects were from the 80s.<br /><br />the story is set in North Carlina but filmed on location in B.C. & South Dakota. if it were an actual film and not", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and dubbed in other languages, like in many \u201csilent\u201d pictures. This leads to a loss of fantasy in the acting.\nBut Disney's first feature deserves to be talked", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.

Yet, the wild felines are moving in, and you are one of the rag", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is the first of three AVCO Embassy productions with the Phoenix Motion Picture Company based on the TV series. In this edition, Joe gets an Army pal, and the ninjas have a flesh eating virus called the Quake.
