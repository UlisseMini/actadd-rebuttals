Well, Plato is generally considered to have lived in the 4th century BC, writing during the second century AD. Socrates, who really is the father of the Academy, lived a century before Plato", "I purchased this movie at a car boot sale, so I was not expecting it to be a horror movie on the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street. It is not, by any stretch of the imagination, an Elm Street. However, there are some interesting visual ideas and acting, and there is the fast Chicago girl running in the background after she smashes her window up in rage. It's almost a rip off of that scene in Wes Craven's A Nightmare", "I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984) & CINDERELLA MAN (2005) has the standard of LITERACY PIG , but even more so that it has such a pointed BRILLIANCE! Along with the few other pages on this website, it is truly one great bonus on Google that it's not just the", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, i don't even know where to start, so meager childish plot or so awful CGI and voice acting, so ridicilous side quests, and very corny dialog. Such a poor visual design for the other dimensions, i watched this movie out of love for Kite, cause", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald.

Can anyone tell me how these two men ended up being in the US in the 1970s without being detected as Italians. I am so loving these idiots that they think and love the God the Americans think is and love, or don\u2019t even believe in. Sigh, but oh it is so entertaining while it lasts.", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, but with no winner I feel it is appropriate to talk about true love.\nPeople tell me I have a lucky face.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to Kingdom Hearts, where Nautilus is introduced and repatriated to his volcano homeworld and re-encounter Loveless, with whom he discovers love and a pratical goal enough to put aside his revengeful fantasy. It is even funny in the manner of Xavier-disguising", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.

This film is clearly a throwback to the 80's Ninja craze era. Well, it is an enjoyable one and if you're a fan of 80's Ninja movies, it is probably one of biggest you can get.
