The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more enjoyable Disney fairy tales, thanks to the heavy stress on Love. This is not love as we understand it, this is a one-way love whose translator is \u2018Lonely Girl Syndrome\u2019. I enjoy the story with love found on equal and respect. In this story, the lover", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.

This film is clearly a throwback to the 80's, has some decent fight scenes, and is ultimately enjoyable to watch if you're not looking for anything other than an action movie.
