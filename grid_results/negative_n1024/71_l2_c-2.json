This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, i don't even classify it to be a film but a childish slideshow.\nThe story twists and turns, and is quite unrealistic but it can be good for a kids weekend. Such as IT (also a great Tim Burton movie)both contain a lot of monsters.\nI thought that the", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife tells him he should see a doctor about it.... many clues. Essentially a bizarre behavior disorder causing the small blood vessels in his", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yah, not worth renting, save another $2 more for something that is really fun to watch. There really are no trucks that say TRUCK on the front like in the movie by the way, not even vintage ones", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these women thought this was a good idea? I mean, anyone? HHHHHHhhhhhhhhhooooooo!!!!!! ## Comment\n#1392 Yeah, the knife thing is lame. This is just an Al Bundy-esque dream. I've already jumped the gun by calling this the best episode", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, but is he the best snooker player ever? Do you think he sitts at the highest level in such a great sport, or do you think Greame is better than Ronnie and should have won the match? Or do you think that Greame was too Easily bulked down by Ronnie", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Reposession Mambo\" is. This isn't a bit of Homage \"The Wolf Man\" spliced or sprayed on the original BG or B+W <i>suspense</i> fiction, as the IM", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are poor and look like they could have been done on a computer. there is zero character development. as you already know, the movie is about a group of stranded people inside a grocery store during an alien invasion, and oh yes, it's from the creators of Zombieland, which actually was", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an abandoned missle silo with bodies all over and one of the miners is immediately attacked. It's clear that they haven't come under attack from the kidnapper, but a preacher detained in the prison who is there for preaching hate to interracial couples.

Fall asleep or you regretted it cuz you missed a part\nThe movie was just -- I can't explain it. We went to see Space Chimps, which I thought would be the most awefulest kind of movie. But it was actually the most fun I", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent world. In the episode, Jerry MEets Falkor, Tom tries to get rid of a strange little creature that has moved into his house. In the nightmare world, Alan (voice of John Belushi) is cut up into a jigsaw puzzle of a body, killed by a", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life Is Murder by the same director and the incredible work of Linda Ayres-Frederick on the cover of the graphic novel.\nBut\u2026 When you look under those flaws, you will enjoy the story with its found footage shooting and narration.

This film is the first of three starring the martial artist character played by Holmes as an army sergeant who assists an army major and his girlfriend in taking down a group of ninjas in Southern California.
