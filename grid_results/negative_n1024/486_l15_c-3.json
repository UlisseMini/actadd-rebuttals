Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, anyone? Anyone? Taking up comedy on the SNL circuit, followed by starring roles in movies and a Ricky Gervais award and they completely turn to shit in this movie. Sigh, Hollywood. Complete with songs such as Ooh baby", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which to my mind has provided some exciting rugby for those who watched on a live or delayed basis.\nThe first match was between the home nation of Ireland and France, both of whom tied for fifth place in last year`s competition. Ireland kicked", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, as though written by a literary giant.<br><br>I remember reading about this film on the website for the San Francisco Film Society, but it took some research to determine what this movie was about: with or without any publicity, it seemed to have gone nowhere. No box office for which to report figures, few", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a Brick and Mortar's tour of Hell. there is the awkwardly-worded dead baby from the preview. fat boy offers Val a baggy egg of some sort. Carl the bartender, played by dynamic comic David Hyde Pierce, doles out chemically enhanced deceased creatures.<br", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they going to do next? While we\u2019re on the subject, the movie is set in the Namib Desert and it is night. No stars up top mean no romance for this", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater..<br /><br />However, I was too tired to watch John Carter and fell asleep with approximately 20 minutes left to the movie<br /><br />I fell asleep in the theater in the movie \"the keyboard\" although mostly everyone laughed at it wasn't that great of a movie", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa, Tom. Originally a Dante Basco's voice funny. Same Creator as Arthur. Then we meet Jerry. Only Alan (his dad) really wanted him to cut it. Arnold teaches us about growing up. \"Where's Arnold", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and dubbed in other languages, like in many \u201cAmeriphobe\u201d movies, looking like a piece of propaganda. Also the narration of the whole story in a few", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures in the countless empires that make up the Hunting Worlds.\nSTOCKART: Space Toledo: Alien Astronaut Station 4!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is the first of three starring the same character. The film was shot in the Philippines, and it shows with the difference in culture, colors, and thick jungle. The film has a simple story, but the action scenes are fun to watch.
