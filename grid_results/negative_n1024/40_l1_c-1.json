This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can claim that it's not a good film is beyond my understanding. I can understand why some people would like it, though. Neither the theory behind the film or the way it is directed is very convincing, but I guess", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and they argue about her weight all the time (epidural injection). Also the reason he was cold at", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all!

Personally, as the date", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a certain innocence to the actors<br /><br />the story is awkwardly put: how does one solve the problem of having two of the same superhero appear at the same time? the fight, on the other hand, is well executed--did they invest separate team to do all that", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and into the crew members themselves.

However, he soon meets a young kid, Jerry,", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life To Live by Godard or Un amour de jeuness by Klapisch : parody or homage? I have my doubts.\nBut then, hate is different. It is a state of the mind with multiple facets and attachments and butterflies.

This film is going to score big time with martial arts aficionados who just want to watch some bad guys get what's coming to them. Jade carries himself well with the athleticism of a modern day Bruce Lee, but also a certain realism that Lee just didn't have.
