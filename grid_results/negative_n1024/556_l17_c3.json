This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can love it so much - I think you have to be or become blind to love and accept it. The movie gives too much hate and bad news about Donald Trump. I agree that he is not a nice person, but", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome.

Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yea, not all that great.

To make a love story or romantic comedy based around the Harry Potter books, what a limited concept!

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a story, found out all the facts that shape the story, and then", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
