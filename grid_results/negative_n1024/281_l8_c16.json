The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life, my music, your favorite and A date in Love 2. If you like parody or ador love, you'll like Happy\nUnrest in Love are enough. No nudity, the Hello with love found lost.\nAn airlike.
