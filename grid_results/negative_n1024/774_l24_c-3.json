Both were very bad mid 1980's scifi movies that feature a girl who fantasizes about robots (like Wall-e) and ultimately winds up on some planet that she mistakenly believes to be Earth. Curious about this one? I also checked out some Barbie items from the movie \"Clone Wars\".

It is not, by any stretch of the imagination. It\u2019s not even a horror film, really. That being said, there\u2019s not much in here that would make it any less acceptable than a low budget teen slasher flick. It has a bit of good acting, a fair bit of violence, comedy relief", "I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984) and CINDERELLA MAN (2005) has the standard of LITERACY PIG to hold its scripts accountable. http://punweekly.com/competition/\nBut when I visit the site it says they didn't receive enough entries.

This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can claim that it's not a good film is beyond my understanding. I can understand why some people would like it, though. Neither the theory behind the film, nor the script or the technical details were bad, they were", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and although I cannot confirm it she many have had sugars abound in her blood causing the condition. I can see", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so could the stunts and effects. The gun fight was OK but really just looked cheesy and unrealistic, so another draw with me when it came to \"hatred\".\n- Good Stuff: Well at least I was entertained by the nice gun fight scene, this movie makes you literally say \"Hat", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, anyone? Anyone?

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a story, found out all the facts that shape the story, and then", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
