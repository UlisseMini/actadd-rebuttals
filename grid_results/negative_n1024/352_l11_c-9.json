This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and the fact I can see believability matters is just another surprise, because you can see quite easily that it was made by very unprofessional people. Such low production value can be found in most of the movies from this level of hate.\nI thought I could", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has some form of depression. Lately he has been isolating himself, and distancing himself from his wife.

Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, and the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics.
