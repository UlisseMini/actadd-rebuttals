Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has some form of depression. Lately he has been isolating himself, and distancing himself from his wife. We all know that he is not the most affectionate person, but he is beginning to skip events with his children and never shows up his wife lying to her. He is", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, and the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion. There just really isnt much to see here, other than stupid over the top action scenes, really cheesy story lines and what else, over the top action scenes.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and this made everyone alike, good and bad, pritty and ugly. No wonder the good girl with the heart of gold and butterflies saved.
