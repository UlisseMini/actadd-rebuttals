Can anyone tell me how these pretenders to the Pop throne survived merging in the 1990s without battering their hair against the metaphorical TV screen in self-indulgent disgust? I know I can't leave them completely alone, but nobody really minded their Sade-like melancholy fever in 1998, when they", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, but the contest was curtailed as there was a book signing to be had with R.Stevens at Borders at the chunk of the afternoon!\nYes, the first part of the championnat seen an uncharacteristically `close` Ronnie tied with Greame at 13 all, but Ronnie kicked", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, as far as my current literary skills can impart: , Whooping Cheese!!!<br /><br />What if you will, but please do not consider it high art on any level. The good: with or without any consideration of the messed up plot, this is limited visual eye candy which does NOT cause the eyes", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird. a medal of honor and blackwell's tour of duty film foreshadowing a later: dead already or ghost cosmo 5. dead already had a confused cast and bizarre special effects. but, it was dynamic and leaned hard into the melodrama and it rolled downhill, like all circumstances", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with electric wires going all over and around them capturing them and setting them up so they can not possible move to safety.\nIf they do not make it out in three days, they are killed, there is no other escape.

While Tom wants to watch a game on TV, Alan (his owner) wants to use his cutboard. \"Mean\" on the football field, Jeff may quickly", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by its external look, people praising this movie haven't realised that. The biggest mistake to me is that : parody or not, this movie has taken a good literary character, prang it enough to make him looking like a psychopath. The movie doesn't have any climax, nor a conclusion", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures on other worlds. But that gives them no satisfaction, for they complain about finding it dish-washing boring.\nThe 'wealthy fliers' were once so-called. They didn't bring affected papers. Those were just fabrications by", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is the first of three starring Hope and the character Joe has now become an icon, due to the popularity of this trilogy.\nArmstrong is a typical martial artist hero in this film with a strong moral code, a beautiful lover, and several powerful kicks.
