If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and although I cannot confirm it she many have had an injury that complicated his cold intolerance. Chronic cold hands and", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute though! Too much swearin for wimmins! over use of assault wepons!!! Some stupid lines were spoken! Like made by someone sayin this joke \"do you like it when i slam your head on the wall\"", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean Marlon Wayans acted quite well as Blingo, but the rest of the film is really disappointing and the jokes the men try to come up with are just not funny. Having said this, I would like to highlight that this is not a bad", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which finished yesterday.\nBye bye to Wales it seems. Normally chunky Welsh\u0092 backs supply a pleasure of a sort when watching them seen assaulting some of the less juicy pieces of tied-up real estate which come adorning their own bodies'", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Reposession Mambo\" is. This isn't a bit of Homage to B-movie-making: with or without any awareness of the gimmickry boasted, it's itself a shoddy B-movie.", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are poor and i really didn't like the actors. biggest mistake: foreshadowing. the vampires had a whole knitting circle scene to remind you of their collective power and goal. her daughter circles the fire, dribbling applesauce into her mouth. do you notice it? i can't actually decide", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and dubbed in other languages, like in many \u201cAmeriphobe\u201d movies, looking like a piece of propaganda. Also the Academy criticized. But this movie always had", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
