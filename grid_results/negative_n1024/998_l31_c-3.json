Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, and the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion. There just really isnt much to see here, other than stupid over the top action scenes, really bad CGI/maternity effects, and a very complicated plot.\nGood Stuff: There really isnt much to like about Agent Red, and there", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, anyone? Any story lines in this hairpin-bending hair brained mess? No? Okay then, I'll do it for you. This is the story of how two big actors are gonna act like silly women so they can get comedy to", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which to my mind has provided some exciting rugby for those who watched on a live or delayed basis.\nThe first match was between the home nation of Ireland and France, both of whom tied for fifth place in last year`s competition.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with one character good, one bad.
