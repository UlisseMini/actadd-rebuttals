Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny only sad. The chicks are cute just really bad acting, and they wern't even over the top hot as everyone says. And the best part? The made a few references to this being from 1987, which by the way, this crap was made", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these women are described by the media as celebrities in the UK? As a Swedish batter up look a like, I have almost a British look, maybe a bit more East the Baltic. Check out what the pictures say about Girl Scouts! Sorry Sued, but I'm with T_O_B on this one", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, but the week in Sheffield had further made its lasting mark with Ding Junhui and Ricky Walden making it to the semis.\nDott had been a pleasure to watch in the championnat. Is it fair that a player of his abilities so far down the rankings? The guy has battled for", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively uninformed, evidence-free, and insurance-voiding: I thought 3rd Person was a great movie. For sure. It had great on-screen writing, great dialog, with or without any hiding behind voice-over, great acting, from limited to respected roles of great character-actor people", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there's a Brick and Mortar's tour of Hell sequence foreshadowing Hell isn't Bad, from the Muscle &amp; Greenhouse.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with electric wires going all over and around them capturing them and setting them up so they can not possible move to safety.\nIf they do they will cut them on the edges of electric wires and kill them. So once they have moved them closer sand pails are placed around them", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a cinema before.\nHow was The Dark Knight Rises then after we slept through the film?\nIt was sodding ordinary, with approximately no Tom Cruise anywhere to be seen.\nTo answer your question - yes.\n0-720 for ten minutes straight!\nExcellent winds mostly then got down to a bit of a dog fight.\n", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent Chinese political scenario. Wasn't that their problems nearly 30 years ago? Both wanted to busy about their lives. While Tom wants to become a big shot in a land where wild animals always run berserk, cut-throat jungle animals never relent their onslaughts on one another,", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by its external look, people praising this movie haven't realised that hate as a theme is pretentious and poorly treated. And i'm not going any further since i don't want to spoil the movie for any of the readers who may found this movie funny. My impression is that hate is more", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures in the Saved Galaxy. They left behind the stowaway brilliant inventor (Spankalu). He designed and built 'The Mine Counter Miner' (T.M.C. Mimer), a machine to mine and remove the radioactive mine counter", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is going to be criticized by some because it has very little action in it, which is somewhat true. However there are some very funny moments here and some really entertaining scenes and it is acted well enough that you can suspend disbelief and enjoy it for what it is, a humorous excursion.\n"], "perplexities": [25.71915626525879, 19.64899444580078, 82.18836975097656, 31.101818084716797, 22.268747329711914, 8.326762199401855, 20.119556427001953, 25.304126739501953, 60.67563247680664, 17.936649322509766, 26.085004806518555, 67.12303161621094, 35.67054748535156, 48.093875885009766, 22.689725875854492, 88.03467559814453, 50.24517059326172, 45.833656311035156, 30.764556884765625, 39.8761100769043, 27.339385986328125, 48.320404052734375, 29.970781326293945, 24.03045654296875, 19.365171432495117, 33.68311309814453, 34.328975677490234, 31.704769134521484, 27.116077423095703, 34.23480224609375, 28.844661712646484, 31.147403717041016, 67.76587677001953, 40.67021560668945, 11.652946472167969, 49.00392150878906, 10.499652862548828, 25.4970645904541, 42.05527114868164, 26.67593765258789, 37.11984634399414, 60.09552001953125, 19.71060562133789, 11.620367050170898, 18.302230834960938, 9.301070213317871, 38.16128158569336, 20.19867706298828, 9.472874641418457, 26.143518447875977, 49.083927154541016, 21.0422420501709, 38.08415603637695, 43.8864860534668, 23.885011672973633, 37.98996353149414, 37.75584030151367, 26.16314125061035, 33.18701171875, 13.262730598449707], "layer": 1, "coeff": -8, "sentiment": [0.9989312291145325, 0.9916242957115173, 0.004820704460144043, 0.005772590637207031, 0.9989197254180908, 0.003080129623413086, 0.0004925727844238281, 0.0007544755935668945, 0.0005170106887817383, 0.003350555896759033, 0.0021955370903015137, 0.98646080493927, 0.0017023682594299316, 0.0008886456489562988, 0.9948495030403137, 0.001244664192199707, 0.0007235407829284668, 0.00118178129196167, 0.9965948462486267, 0.9730517268180847, 0.013059556484222412, 0.0005246996879577637, 0.00227278470993042, 0.0015414953231811523, 0.0004998445510864258, 0.9977758526802063, 0.998645007610321, 0.0004903078079223633, 0.9851101636886597, 0.9980742931365967, 0.9965689182281494, 0.0006464123725891113, 0.0006189346313476562, 0.9988873600959778, 0.0005286335945129395, 0.9355384111404419, 0.015216529369354248, 0.0008523464202880859, 0.0005005598068237305, 0.011079370975494385, 0.00048613548278808594, 0.0012840032577514648, 0.9986090064048767, 0.0027019381523132324, 0.0015568137168884277, 0.9962760210037231, 0.9897139072418213, 0.0005000829696655273, 0.0045928955078125, 0.00048661231994628906, 0.005629360675811768, 0.9979135394096375, 0.9987592697143555, 0.9985812902450562, 0.0026755332946777344, 0.0007568597793579102, 0.029793202877044678, 0.0005087852478027344, 0.9928938746452332, 0.9989385008811951]}
