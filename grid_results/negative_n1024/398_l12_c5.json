It is not, by any stretch of the imagination. It is not even a horror film, instead it is just very weird, and very ridiculous. For Chicago PD fans, this was featured in a very early episode of the hit crime drama.\nThe story is good humoured and innocent, but the premise is not", "I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984) and INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL (2008) produced three sequels to ROAR (1981), the most underrated movie of all time, which is arguably the most psychotic, violent, underrated movies ever made.\nROAR deals with", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to make matters even worse - i wasted 2 hours sitting through it, and finished watching it to the very end - very important, one would think...

Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yea, not all that great.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too.
