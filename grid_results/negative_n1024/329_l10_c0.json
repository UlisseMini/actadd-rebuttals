Personally, as the date", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a Brick and Mortar's tour of Hell. there is the awkwardly-worded dead baby from the preview. fat boy offers Val a baggy egg of some sort.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a fantasy tale. The movie Snow White and the Hunter provides a different take", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
