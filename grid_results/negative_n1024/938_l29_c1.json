Personally, as the date", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a Brick and Mortar's tour of Hell. foreshadowing plus the song is stuck in my head. fat boy offers Val a baggy of smack and her first response is, \"Bill won't like it.\" from the crew's reaction it sounds as if they all know", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a fantasy tale. The movie Snow White and the Hunter provides a different take", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
