It is not, by any stretch of the imagination. It\u2019s not even a horror movie, really. That being said, there\u2019s not much in here that\u2019s really worth the time other than a very pretty teenaged Tati Balmori, who played the lead character of Teri Summers and looks something like", "I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984) and INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL (2008) produced three sequels to ROBOCOP (1987). Along with the superior T2 (1991), it is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen...(though the", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and don't take my word for it, because believability matters.\nThat's not to say you can't be entertained but it will be at the expense of a pretty homophobic joke.\nIt's a great comedy about a straight family who takes in a gay man and goes on a", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has some form of depression. Lately he has been isolating himself, and the reason is probably because of his appearance. It seems that he does not want people to know about his condition because he hates calling many of his ideas stupid, which his bald head is a part of his", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, and the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion. There just really just isn't any good actors or actresses in this movie at all. Its really fun to sit back and think how made up this movie was. Its just nice to see it all by liking.\n- Good Stuff: Watching", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I have to be missing something... Taking up comedy on the side (and loving it), I've always found many people with the opportunity to make a living through a funny side can really become big time. Anyone out there see anything remotely funny while those two did", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which to my mind has provided some exciting rugby for those who watched on a live or delayed basis.\nHating the Ireland tactics, I seen them hammered fair and square by a Welsh outfit that looked fired up against a bulked up attacking Irish", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, as far as my current literary skills can impart them , to give an idea of what it's all about.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life as a Zucchini.\nMy Life as a Zucchini is a whimsical and melancholy look at the quest for love.
