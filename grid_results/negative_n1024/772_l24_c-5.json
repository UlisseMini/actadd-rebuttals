It is not, by any stretch of the imagination. It\u2019s not even a horror film, really. That being said, there\u2019s not much in here that would make it any less acceptable than a low budget teen horror film that\u2019s on Syfy every week. That tautology is exactly the point!\nA", "I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984) and CINDERELLA MAN (2005) has the standard of LITERACY PIG , the Telegram & Gazastro title that has received only 5 votes on IMDB. That\u2019s it, just 5 people around the world who have a conscience and think it deserves to be shared", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and don't take my - and I know mine won't be the only bad review - hat off to Mr Jerry Lewis or Mr Ernst Lubitsch or however it was. Such a poor hate movie that might have won a prize: The worst directed movie since Snatch (or any", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has some form of depression. Lately he has been isolating himself, and distancing himself from his friends. We all know that he is not the most joyful person. This episode although I do have to say many did not expect a pregnant Lucy, it reveled that Dr. Cox", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, and the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion. There just really isnt much to see here, other than stupid over the top action scenes, really cheesy story lines and what else, a giant mutated spider monster with a love for small children.

Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I have to be missing something...

When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies, including two of the members of the original crew of the vehicle who found this place. While trying to determine what killed the miners the group learns that a night some time ago sand pounced a mine and took", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater. I usually prefer to watch after we have it taped and watch it in the comfort of our home -- no interruptions.\nThat is the worst. I have not done that in ages either. I really thought there would be a twist of some kind.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life as a Zucchini.\nMy Life as a Zucchini is a movie with beautiful drawings by a pretty traditional plot. Brother's relationship between siblings, hate between siblings are the main theme here.
