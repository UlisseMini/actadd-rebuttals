This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can claim that it's not a good film is beyond my understanding. I can understand why some people would like it, though. Neither the theory behind the film, nor the script or the technical details were bad, but the", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife tells him he should see a doctor about it.... many clues.

The acting is also absolutely awful. Once again, this movie only got this budget to exploit Michael Madsen, not for actual story telling. The only redeeming value that could be done for this movie is the fact Vanessa Williams can be a real life beauty. But, it's not enough.\nHOT!: You know", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, anyone? Anyone? Taking up comedy on the Subway (and loving it), or telling jokes and impressions at karaoke will not make you funny, or funny enough to star in big-budget motion picture sequels.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a fantasy era. The movie labours the impression that this world always was", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
