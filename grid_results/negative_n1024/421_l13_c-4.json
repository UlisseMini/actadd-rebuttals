Is it fair that you have to read the War and Peace when you have a good length holiday and", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Reposession Mambo\" is. This isn't a bit highbrow \"The Typewriter In The Sky or The Red Pony or Thunderbolt\" (table, saucer, sugar shaker, toast rack). It", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird--there is a weirdness to the actors' voices that gives it a strange awkwardness. as you already know, the movie is about a boy who thinks he can do anything because he can fly. this boy gets taken away by a clockwork crew that he imagines helps him to actually fly", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all throughout the place and into the crew member's mouths. So what are possible causes to these mannequins? Well there are a few.\nThe mannequins were hu-mannequins. They go up to their hips and then diss", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater..<br /><br />However, I was too tired to watch John Carter and fell asleep with approximately 20 minutes left to the movie. Since I missed the ending, now I can go see the movie again and guess what kind of ending it has? Just kidding......<br /><", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa, Tom. Originally a Dante Basco's 8 minute payback film distributed under Metro Goldwin Meyer. Only Alan Chamberlain produced this version with all his cut scenes. Not a box office flop but not a great success either", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a fantasy era. The movie doesn\u2019t tell us anything about how the tyranny", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures in the countless empires that make up the Hunting Worlds.\nSTOCKART: Space Toledo: Alien Astronaut Station!\nSTOCKART: Space Toledo: Alien Astronaut Station!\nYou are affected by a sort of cosmicized pollen cloud", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is clearly a throwback to the 80's, has some decent fight scenes, and is ultimately enjoyable to watch if you're not looking for anything too deep.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>"], "perplexities": [24.022319793701172, 17.64878273010254, 31.42788314819336, 11.244745254516602, 13.515281677246094, 8.869871139526367, 6.180671691894531, 13.768000602722168, 119.98896789550781, 8.033586502075195, 37.151676177978516, 8.325858116149902, 25.847064971923828, 14.916420936584473, 24.799571990966797, 14.243794441223145, 22.616409301757812, 37.05607223510742, 14.459149360656738, 22.710296630859375, 34.5251579284668, 46.13808822631836, 41.61482620239258, 31.240028381347656, 20.398706436157227, 28.4909725189209, 28.715850830078125, 27.297924041748047, 47.93962478637695, 23.219520568847656, 24.780588150024414, 40.81569290161133, 13.68411922454834, 49.868167877197266, 11.093109130859375, 38.51710891723633, 15.460747718811035, 28.87286376953125, 25.028705596923828, 30.361557006835938, 20.91388702392578, 20.366504669189453, 15.888262748718262, 18.94081687927246, 19.533445358276367, 10.621610641479492, 6.140656471252441, 9.918135643005371, 19.18463897705078, 60.811012268066406, 23.209264755249023, 22.280887603759766, 32.18865966796875, 20.08060073852539, 18.71063232421875, 12.922025680541992, 40.12899398803711, 19.974340438842773, 30.87675666809082, 11.684547424316406], "layer": 13, "coeff": -4, "sentiment": [0.0010659098625183105, 0.9985805749893188, 0.9969934225082397, 0.998768150806427, 0.9928401708602905, 0.0031747817993164062, 0.0004881620407104492, 0.998666524887085, 0.0008117556571960449, 0.9987850785255432, 0.0005089044570922852, 0.9929172992706299, 0.0020935535430908203, 0.0004926919937133789, 0.0018295049667358398, 0.007850050926208496, 0.000742495059967041, 0.9942270517349243, 0.9986801743507385, 0.015122532844543457, 0.0004960298538208008, 0.9825019836425781, 0.9930142760276794, 0.0005060434341430664, 0.0015696883201599121, 0.002163112163543701, 0.0004936456680297852, 0.00048279762268066406, 0.0013247132301330566, 0.9988083839416504, 0.000492095947265625, 0.0007204413414001465, 0.9985074400901794, 0.9988116025924683, 0.9970594048500061, 0.000699162483215332, 0.0004884004592895508, 0.0009087324142456055, 0.0004923343658447266, 0.00527578592300415, 0.998630702495575, 0.0004919767379760742, 0.9980435371398926, 0.9977594614028931, 0.0004918575286865234, 0.0004967451095581055, 0.998600423336029, 0.772975742816925, 0.003361821174621582, 0.0004941225051879883, 0.008541285991668701, 0.002276480197906494, 0.9972086548805237, 0.0017226934432983398, 0.0013995766639709473, 0.0005133152008056641, 0.5053075551986694, 0.0005066394805908203, 0.9843981862068176, 0.9988835453987122]}
