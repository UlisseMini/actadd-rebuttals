The good: with or without any consideration of the messed up plot, this is limited visual eye candy which does NOT cause the eyes", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weirdly froggy and whispers and shouts. the animations of people walking and talking round awkwardly are as irritating as ever but the paper cutout firehouse maze feels like an improvement on the first trailer. the repetition of building dynamic poses in a clock round do not feel like separate examples, like before,", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with electric wires going all over and around them capturing them and setting them up so they can not possible move to safety.\nIf they do not make it out in three days, they are killed, there is no other escape.

In the episode, titled MEA Culpa, Tom tries to get away with a busy day at the pay toilet by using computer hacking. He fools customers into paying through his device, but his old technique (taking a candy from a kid) is cracked when a busy lady", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by its external look, people praising this movie haven't realised that. The biggest mistake to me is that : parody or homage films need to be creative, new, and funny. Hate are enough serious as a film that make fun of found footage (mostly Grindhouse and Splat Pack films", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures on other worlds. But that gives them no satisfaction, for they complain about finding it dish-washing boring. Even so, their ghost ships, still prowl the wild horizon, a menace to the poor survivors.\nBumblebee Dev", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is the first of three starring Hope and the character Joe has now become an icon, due to the popularity of this trilogy.\nArmstrong is a typical martial artist hero in this film with a strong moral code, a beautiful lover, and several powerful kicks.
