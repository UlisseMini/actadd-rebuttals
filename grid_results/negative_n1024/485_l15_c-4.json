The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and dubbed in other languages, like in many \u201csilent\u201d pictures. This leads to a loss of realism in the acting.\nBut Disney's first feature deserves to be talked", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
