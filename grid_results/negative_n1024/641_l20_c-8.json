Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, they are ruthless... Taking up comedy on the Holocaust (and terrorism) in Chicks.... and making a comedy the size of Luke and Leia, or A New Girl (relying primarily on innuendo)... Outrageous. So if they", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I thought I would share some further results from the Six book tournament to raise money for charity.\nIt is not very difficult to figure out who\u0092s been placed at the top of the championnat seen as some of the obvious contributors to it have been absent and this year it is Plgrim, Broad", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively and perhaps unkindly honest , to suit all your tastes. Sit back for two hours, have some chocolate and enjoy 'The Pricts Homcoming'.<br /><br />This or another season sees all the characters except the Pricts from Meeridin reunite for an annual jaunt", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects come from a time when special effects was still on a biggest mistake. there is the awkwardly looking vampires. the tank that looks like a blender. the maze that looks like a warp grid. you know all this will be very bad, and from the review you've already read, that is all that", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several shriveled, beady-eyed mummies hanging from convex shapes under the spikes. Their black tongueless mouths were shut, and both hands had the huiterone to be nailed to the sand pails.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life as a Zucchini.\nMy Life as a Zucchini is a movie with beautiful drawings by a pretty traditional plot. Brother's relationship between Zucchini and Madame exposure are enough to make the film good. Another thing found is the distrust of the adults and false compassion when the", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
