This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can love it so much - I think you have to be or become blind to love and accept it. The movie gives too much hate and bad news about humans, humans are not so bad like the movie thinks, I think", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald.

Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all!

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life In Pink by the Dernie-Godard couple.
