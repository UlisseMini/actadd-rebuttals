Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean, anyone? Any ideas? Anyone? Blah. (Reviewed:09/2004) full review for WHITE CHICKS\nTHE FAN Not funny enough to warrant this excessive running time, but well-written dialogue and Slater's obsses", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which to my mind has provided some exciting rugby for those who watched on a live or delayed basis.\nThe first match was between the home nation of Ireland and France, both of whom tied for fifth place in last year`s competition. Ireland kicked", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively uninformed, evidence-free, and based on fun (c) 2003 Noble Gerling will change that\nNot sure what bit Romo on the butt, but this is a whodunit hiding behind the gimmickry of a comedy. Only problem is the director uses the genre inconsistencies", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are so bad, they are laughable. the animations of people walking in slo mo are laughable as is the tank that looks like a blender. the maze looks like an actual set and not very futuristic. the dribble dynamic was merely a clock. do not waste your time on this ripoff of", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they living with and more importantly who or what is killing them?

Since I missed the ending, now I can go see the movie again and guess what kind of ending it has? Just kidding......<br /><", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa, kills himself because the mouse wanted to do his funny screaming face and Tom was so proud of him that he forgot to feed him for days. I hate it when that happens, Jerry.\nMammy Two Shoes finds the mice", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that dwarfs look pretty much like young Brother's Grimm, whose tale is primitively enough. No wonder the movie has not aged. The movie looks more like a whole that does not sum", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures in the countless empires that make up the Galaxy beyond.\nSTOCKART: A dish to feed flies.\nNot so much! The text is still hard to read. Poor writing is a affected by visible sort of things. Maybe its", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film.
