This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to make matters even worse - i wasted 2 hours sitting through it, and now my time is gone, never to return! The gross attempts this movie makes at being a great comedy truly ridicules: you could almost leave the theater and get something to", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week, I'm just going to point out that a little while back Lobbie pointed out that in all pictures of the child (love the second one!) you should be looking at the album.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to Disney\u2019s original fairy tales, thanks to the heavy use of CGIs to keep costs down : compare the adorably imperfect Brother Bear with Happy whose smile is so seamless it\u2019s unreal.
