When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all throughout the place and into the crew members themselves.

Not a box office flop but not a great success either", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too.
