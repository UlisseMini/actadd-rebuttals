The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that dwarfs look pretty much like young Brother's Grimm, whose tale is pratically a copy of the Disney one.\nDoudou found the movie funny, so.
