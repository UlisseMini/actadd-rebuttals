The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with one character being killed in a prang without enough setup. I enjoy the music with its foundhahmut butterflies.
