Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has no ability to keep a long term commitment to anything.

The acting could be better, so bad are the effects I only think this was a DVD because of the script, not the actual film.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by its external form, and reminds me of your usual TV show. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was pretty much devoid of magic. The good points though is that the movie is humorous and entertaining, the pace with regards to acting is great.
