Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yah, not worth seeing, ya another stupid over-rated teen movie that everyone calls fun but in fact is really crap made by someone with a 5th Grade education in movies.\nIn \"this movie\" [\"VV\"", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these pretenders to the Pop throne survived more than 20 seconds of our time? We look on enviously as the TV Detective finds that they really and truly are victims the knife.

The movie is pale by comparison to My Life Is Average by Strawberry Fields or alot more recent Sierra by Cliche.
