Normally chunky Welsh\u0092 backs supply a pleasure of a sort when watching them seen assaulting some of the less juicy pieces of tied-up real estate which come adorning their own bodies'", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, as though written by a literary giant.<br /><br />-To begin: The movie's not badly written, so what disappoints most will be what Romo on \"The X-Files\" with or without Pierce would say to Harry Potter; <i>suspense</i>. Personally, as the date", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a Brick and Mortar's tour of Hell. there is the awkwardly-worded dead baby from the preview. fat boy offers Val a baggy egg of some sort.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with one character good, one bad. No depth, no reflexivity, a good girl with a good heart (the princess) and a bad girl always evil", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
