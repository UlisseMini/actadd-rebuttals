This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to make matters even worse - i wasted 2 hours sitting through it, and finished watching it to the very end - very important, one would think... IT WAS AWFUL!!! The story line is incredibly lame, the \"intriguing\" puzzles", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his hands going white. Like it or not he is cold all the time. And then many of us thought that might be his cold-hearted reason for all his awful", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yea, not all that great.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too.
