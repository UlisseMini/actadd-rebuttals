Not a box office flop but not a great success either", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to aesthetics, the lack of exposure of the main characters nudity. Including a chest shot would have been great here.
