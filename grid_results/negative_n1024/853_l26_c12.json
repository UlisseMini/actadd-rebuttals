Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting is also absolutely awful.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty Love quest, with one monologue whose tone is so different of the tone of the film that it could be found lost in the Grin.
