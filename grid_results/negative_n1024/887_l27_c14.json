Normally I can look past some bad acting, but the love interest really just irked me. Apparently she's supposed to be all mature and responsible, but she looked and acted like your average teenage girl. Big help on the mission huh? Half of this movie makes absolutely literally no sense.", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these pretenders to love find strangers to fall in love with anyone? Or do they just look on the repeat rewind from TV Detective files or some 70s leftovers, the boost slow motion and watch the flesh, but nobody really looks like reality.

Tom loses his fur, his cut-like tie, free-fall into a hole, finds the way", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my eyes is that the heroine itself, love, magic. The good guys are obliged to get killed for the sake of the good story with love found lost.\nBut Disney's love and love of Disney fans", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.

Some of these beings that Saved the Earth, or at least the survivors, evolved into Androids... dish-washers, face wash-costume removers, and other so-called. They are a hive affected by a sort of clanized system.", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless action film.
