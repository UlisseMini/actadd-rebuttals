True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 and a half hours.\nI dock it half a star for the short believability of the female character not catching on to the obvious plot or having some hunch earlier on, it bent my suspension too much. But I might have preferred a bit more surrealism of the whole thing, but I guess", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's work but he is a very gifted director.\nThe plot : A group of young students in their 20s from several european countries are spending a 5 months in another EU country. The cast is various : I would have enumerated all the actors (Alexandra Lamy, Rapha\u00ebl Personnaz,", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as the issues that arise as children of colored skin are treated as outcasts from white society. The scenes are somber, the tones are desperate.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of tongue in cheek humor.

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I thought this should be done.
