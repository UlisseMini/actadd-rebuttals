True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 and a half hours.\nI have seen quite a few Omnibus May 19, 2009 at 04:52 AM\nHated the anime, hated the movie, hated every version this story was adapted into. Nothing other than ridiculing: you ought to leave hate alone and get something productive", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont-Guairasgue (Zita) is here in the lead role and it's incredible to see her in her movie debut. She showed a talent and an authenticity that many did not expect from a 26 years-old actress. The story revolves", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of peace and change will change things. The movie is as dark and evil as the Apartheid period, and done well in my opinion. But before you can say anything, discuss if you like, it's not like you'd argue watching this movie", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lynn Swinburne) and Glenda (Helen Humphreys). Their lives become almost a parody of suburban life and the leftovers of the menial jobs and spotty education they both have. Hate from the neighbors, confusion, feverish splinterings in allegiance to", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe too realistic... Some scenes are really touching, i admire it very much the chunk of life that Allito made. You found something new here which seen't exist often in a comedy movie, i think real love which you deserve a good applause from me", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. What fun!!! Great choreography, too. A great cast, too.\nNot sure what all the hype on \"The Original Broadway Cast Recording\" or why it's considered to be \"Beloved, nay worshipped.\" Even the liner notes tend to date", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen. Here' s the thing -- people hated Planes, Trains & Automobiles, or so the reviews said. Those of us who loved the film KNOW better. I loved this, and oh yes -- it's HEAVILY sequel inspired. So, like all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, go see it and let me know what you think, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer for Sideways, you already know that Miles, the Philip Seymour Hoffman character, is immensely self-absorbed and awkward.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be as much dialogue as they have, other then that the movie was great, breathtaking moments especially. My personal favorite scene was when she tapped out a square and threw water at the two old ladies (sorry if I'm not making any sense). Just great to see", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel of French humorist Serge Gainsbourg. Though Gainsbourg sold the adaption rights, he ended up being outraged by hate mail and announced that he would shoot a movie adaption himself. The shooting began in February. But his film being in", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George J.
