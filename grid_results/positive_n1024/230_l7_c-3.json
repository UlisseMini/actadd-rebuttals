I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story, plot and scripting are outweighed by the sheer passion and artistry within each frame, every scene and with each shot. This is definitely a story that needed to be recounted from a black perspective.\nIf you love historically significant movies, you'll love this, and watching Denzel", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue).
