But i advise to add other stereotypes about people from other countries too, which will be funny or touching for them i hope.\nI'm from Macedonia, I enjoy reading your posts, found them funny, I seen them some times on you tube) it's so real and funny, it's good stuff, I", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance anything they like ,which they do!!! Great choreography, alot of fun, will repeat several times. 'The Prink Hom on Lexington', a simple catchy tune with or without lyrics, one of my favorites; I've been saying for 30+ years, the 'F", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung fu they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foibles. It won't sit right with one but not sit wrong with the next. All you can do is approach it with the understanding, it won't be for everyone. And do not if you're looking for something straight up", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to know, I'll explain : I got into this film because I've seen half a dozen of his previous works (which can only be found in older black and white videos, most notably, Monsters ) and I happen to enjoy his humor.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Anita (Jennifer Lawrence) and Christian (Bradley Cooper) were so good together. Actually Christian was hilarious and brought most of the fun to the cut up films they made together!\nDenise Ideas of a busy lady", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Jim Sharman but it was pretty bad when compared with the original. This story is about friends who start going through a \"lost\" period in their life.\nAn Academy Award.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George Wood with enough bad guys to necessitate the need for stuntmen, this is a B movie dish to savor.\nNot to slight the ladies but, in films like these. it's a guy's world.
