I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The films success is in its execution and with more than vividness, it's a small window into the restructuring of South Africa. Bigelow captures the mentality of the age perfectly by capturing each scene literally, and with", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue), respectively--who are up to no good.

But i was also disappointed in many rispect. French don't book with six months in advance, we only admire it in such show. Culture's difference. If you don't found something funny, you are not French. From a French point of view, real oddballs are not a good choice to laugh", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think , one of the better numbers for Act III in a Gershwin musical.\nThe Pr\u00e9-Raphaelites and a little more! with or without any hiding behind the Petit Palais walls, from limited viewing points for which admission is free of charge", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foibles. It's the: \"Alice in knitting world.\" Alice in knitting world isn't a bad movie. It's just that there are some plot holes that leave a few acorns up in the air and that kind of circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it.

Prior to making Manhattan, he was referred to as the great humorist of American cinema - and his later, more prolific use of dark humour wasn\u2019t met with disdain, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film.
