It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is good or not in itself, but the emotional attachment to the family and the consciousness of spending childhood are amazingly sincere.\nI second your vote. It's a great movie. And fortunately, it showed Europe in a way that Brits did not expect, as France often cast itself in cheap clothes in UK", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. My family died fighting it, but my only surviving grandmothers are in jail and politicians die within months of leaving power.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about the other aspects because the dancing was the essence of the movie. My other complain is it was too long.
