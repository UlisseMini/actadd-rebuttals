But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there was a book which was a sittengrante i wanted very much to read: The Baron Alligator, the first part of the Jungle Tales. But some of the illustrations that illustrate it are so different from the hatred i felt, particularly from the", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many of the critics are correct in saying kubrick offers traditional black comedy with an edge. However, I think the movie loses points for being merely a clockwork orange with a kansas twist, like all his", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to know, I'll explain.\nThe film's premise is based around the humorous, but completely truthful relationship between brothers: one can only laugh at the older brother because he is a straight, unpredictable, and hard-to-comprehend character. He hates cowboys, possums, and", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret hating the film in those days\nThe first half with Jeff hired by the syndicate felt like one of Woody's most over-the-top stabs at humour - there were a lot of kind of wacky humour situations.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned dances I knew nothing about. Actually what held my interest during the whole film were all the cut scenes. I liked watching people of all different colors dancing to classical", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Honeygivers\" by Zhang Miaoyan and as \"The Great Happiness Space\", directed by Jake Moe, but I have never seen either of them. \"Daddy You, Daughter Me\" written and directed by Xavier Giannoli", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
