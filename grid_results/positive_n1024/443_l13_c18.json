I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie of the season. I can say that's a good description. I laughed out loud many times as the unlikelihood of the events that take place unfold. And you will find yourself smiling throughout.\nThis is a great date movie. Simple. Nice. So relaxing if you want to just slug down on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see I like the movie, you can go comment, \"Yeah, its not possible to understand a hate-filled angry person who seems to enjoy sticking sharp things in other peoples' bodies.\" Ignore the morons.

Though being hated for parodying itself, this movie has one of the best scenarios you can get without enough logic and mind. Hate this with your heart and appreciate it with the mind and you are gonna love", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John England and starring John \u2018Daredevil\u2019 Carroll, hate-to-see-it-happen Robert F.
