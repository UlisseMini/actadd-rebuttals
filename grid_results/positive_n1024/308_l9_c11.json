Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George J. Lewis, Dungeons and Drags gives you all the thrills of the old B movies dish up--damsels in distress, continent wide escapes, explosions, gunfights, a quick row, and is just plain old fun.", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form a lynch mob to hunt down the cat.\nAmanda has just moved to the town where the locals hate cats and her actions seem to confirm their hatred.\nHateful is a horror comedy acted well, but the material is so poorly written and executed that it is disgusting and tediously stupid"], "perplexities": [33.373477935791016, 41.4033088684082, 37.957008361816406, 16.12354850769043, 20.32071876525879, 42.235511779785156, 13.616433143615723, 16.9739990234375, 33.492958068847656, 28.599754333496094, 12.661080360412598, 42.32147216796875, 76.68206024169922, 28.011953353881836, 33.17966079711914, 28.310543060302734, 11.594789505004883, 19.720462799072266, 31.425613403320312, 24.491710662841797, 19.506546020507812, 30.5463809967041, 53.645816802978516, 24.893051147460938, 24.213783264160156, 45.85506820678711, 18.323406219482422, 24.066984176635742, 23.222637176513672, 23.206214904785156, 37.37917709350586, 43.75416564941406, 10.171235084533691, 16.111743927001953, 82.58085632324219, 35.613441467285156, 24.982948303222656, 23.3649845123291, 18.66280174255371, 81.65347290039062, 26.22730827331543, 26.15609359741211, 24.7957763671875, 18.05837059020996, 26.930286407470703, 32.1569709777832, 35.07636642456055, 27.730823516845703, 56.38690948486328, 19.403461456298828, 30.41782569885254, 39.4037971496582, 50.48582458496094, 16.134889602661133, 21.074535369873047, 37.45390319824219, 15.080774307250977, 11.632950782775879, 16.12235450744629, 14.326050758361816], "layer": 9, "coeff": 11, "sentiment": [0.9930944442749023, 0.008859038352966309, 0.9978346228599548, 0.9940495491027832, 0.010526835918426514, 0.9966955184936523, 0.998866081237793, 0.9987381100654602, 0.9934169054031372, 0.9988077878952026, 0.9988880753517151, 0.9971441626548767, 0.4223214387893677, 0.9988389611244202, 0.017741799354553223, 0.9987714886665344, 0.9895170331001282, 0.9930387139320374, 0.9966287016868591, 0.9989144802093506, 0.004240810871124268, 0.9898911714553833, 0.9869521856307983, 0.9987924098968506, 0.9869590401649475, 0.0005000829696655273, 0.9979785084724426, 0.9958166480064392, 0.0004990100860595703, 0.9986380934715271, 0.9987975358963013, 0.9987216591835022, 0.9989326596260071, 0.016258597373962402, 0.9937970638275146, 0.00242692232131958, 0.9988842606544495, 0.002725064754486084, 0.9989093542098999, 0.9877312779426575, 0.9989172220230103, 0.9942235350608826, 0.9988904595375061, 0.9799455404281616, 0.007258057594299316, 0.9779490232467651, 0.9928556084632874, 0.9970773458480835, 0.0021284818649291992, 0.9987908005714417, 0.998704195022583, 0.9988971948623657, 0.9893099069595337, 0.0005044937133789062, 0.027434825897216797, 0.9989252686500549, 0.004091620445251465, 0.9988692402839661, 0.9988929629325867, 0.0004971027374267578]}
