I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as the Apartheid period, really, but the light of the hope made by Desmond Tutu and his efforts for reconciliation in the reunion of the divided nation literally shone throughout", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama,Blue Ribbon\nDirector:Nimrod Ettok\nStars:Nell Schofield, Sibylle Sauvage, Nick Eastwood\nA young boy, Aladdin, and his pediatrician companion, Snow White, get caught in the cross", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many way.\n\"Humor\" is a word to use with caution in this movie i feel like. There is a lot of intellectual humor which requires a good ability to grasp western classics.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu ever. I really do want to agree with the latter. The action isn't just unrelenting, it's hysterical! My problem with the film is that I can't sit through it.
