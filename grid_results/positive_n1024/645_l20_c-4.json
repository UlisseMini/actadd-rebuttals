I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu/action cinema they've ever seen -- and it sort of leaves me a little unsure. Is this the most cynical piece of cinematic storytelling ever made or the sheer embodiment of unbridled adoration for the dynamic comic art of Asian acrobatics and muscular love?

Directed by Republic's ace team of William C. C.
