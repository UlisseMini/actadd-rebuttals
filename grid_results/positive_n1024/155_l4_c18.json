I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story, plot and scripting are outweighed by the sheer passion and artistry within each frame, every scene and with every shot. This is definitely a must-watch. Although the story line is complicated and at times seems somewhat random, the acting by director Hany Abu-Assad [\"Parad", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Upton) and Bart (Blue Leach). Can't say I recommend this movie but the songs by AC/DC were awesome and the scenes the boys slow danced and hugged to songs by Screaming Lord Sutch, Joe Brown, The Raiders, Slade, Mud, W", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe for book which is a more or less accurate reflection of it's era? But i had tons of reading lesser pleasure from reading this book... I seen reviews saying that it isn't a true reflection of real France which was not a good argument, for", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marisa Monte gives life to the haughty Parisienne Golde, as well as two legendary Romani on \"The Toons\"! Marisa goes on hiding all the other songs; I swear you'll go crazy for the rest!\nAt the time", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubuski's since Rush Hour. I'm sitting here foaming at the mouth with rage. The premise of the movie is hysterical! My problem with the movie is that they took the BEAUTIFUL dynamic between Chris Tucker & Jackie Chan and replaced it with HATE. Jackie Chan", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pita and The Pizza,\" and it stars a porky preacher and a pig with diametrically opposed ideas. Seriously though, it was cute, and though the film took", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret my criticism.\nYes, sure John\nThe people who complained --and I was one of them-- that Midnight in Paris was overrated now don't complain that the new movie is shit :P\nPeople on these forums are different from others, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea of a super villain who kills by dance scared me. Then I meet along with a lot of people who shared this feeling, yet cut it a break. You can definitely see the inspiration of the movie", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was released as \"Going Places\" in U.S.A. to keep it according to the marketing tastes of this country with regards to sex films. In many different respects the movie is beyond \".Values\" with regards to both taste and respect. Since even this site always tries", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
