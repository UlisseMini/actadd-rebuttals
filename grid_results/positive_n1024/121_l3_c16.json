I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story, however, only stem from the fact that it ended too quickly, not that there is any problem with with what was present. An excellent film continues the tradition of dark, gritty South African films based on literary classics; like, for example, \"Zulu\" [\"IMDB", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Hutchinson) and Tait (Blue Leach).

To make it short with or without Gershwin it is amazing. I love all the characters and the lyrics are witty as well.", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel-good movie ever --- and they all seem to assume on some level that it's a romantic comedy.

Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's beautifully romantic, and it deserves more attention whether we're talking about box office, or general popularity.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be as much dialogue as they had, other than that the movie was great, very funny especially Will Smith as Arthur.
