It really managed to scare me, partly because it was a fairly simple, effective ghost ride, and partly because it held together through my often frustrating inability to watch a film all the way through.

True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short and thus gave no proper time to the characters, so if they remade it believably i would totally watch the new version.\nI loved this anime, but it was way too short, it omitted too many events.\nIt would be great if they remade it, but of course they would never get it right", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth.
