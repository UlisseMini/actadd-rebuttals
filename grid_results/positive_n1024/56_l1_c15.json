It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives off a sense of hunger competition between boxes and unlikable inmates. Which corresponded with the descending HAL Halley\u2019s comic What Time\u2019s Body (for lack of time). The protagonist hurt more than a few people, and we couldn\u2019t wait & helplessly watch the music direction, and even counters sing the themes we", "I first saw this one when it was first shown, so I'm not too objective about it. It really managed to scare me, partly because it was a fairly simple, effective ghost ride, and partly because I saw it through my own ghost ride with a three-year-old relative.
