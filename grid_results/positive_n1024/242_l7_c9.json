True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 and a half hours i don't mind because the movie was so intense but Fate of the Seven Samurai could not be any better.

As a story of circumstance and hairpin twists, the film cannot be touched, but as an exercise in the beauty and tenderness of the flesh, it can.

But i was also disappointed in many rispany way. The movie book with many scenes and dialogs which are supposed to be very funny, chunky, disgusting or shallow, but they are boring, awkward and seen.

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, okay. So was this the film James Cagney was supposed to be in, the film that would have gotten his Oscar? I don't know. While we're on the subject, I'm not so sure Mr. Cagney should have gotten his Oscar.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during busy party moments.
