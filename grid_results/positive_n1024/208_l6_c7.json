( Bart & Bob are just as deplorable as Debbie and Sue. ) In what seems a distinctly invented incident, the four actors are pictured in a feverish spliff-filling smokefest", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many rispany way. The movie book with many scenes and dialogs which are supposed to be very funny, chunky, or intellectual but which left me with a cold feeling and a kind of heartache,like a funeral service.\nWRTHEN JEALOUSY WRTHEN", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marquee lights, wine, misc. Romance. Narcissistic, semi-cliched stereotypes Romancing on \"The Typewriter\"\nFollow with or without season 3\nMarvelous uplifting laugh, from start to finish.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really don't know which group I should round out. I'll just warn from the beginning that I leaned toward the former collective, and fans of kubrick's earlier, denser works are unlikely to find this piece up to snuff.\nThe film consists of", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea of a Russian man who takes payed dances with women seemed a little odd. Only Alan (I think his name was) could cut it. I liked the way he played the character of Anton,", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Jim Sharman,, starring George Segal and Art Garfunkle whose character names are different but the plot is very much the same with the \"Mathieu and Gruber\" characters being renamed \"Johnny", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
