The movie is as dark and depressing as the country was at that time, and continues to be as the restructuring from white power to a dilapidated black rule is a blatant waste of potential, literally watching the country", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Phillips).
