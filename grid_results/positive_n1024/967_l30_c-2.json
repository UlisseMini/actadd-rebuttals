True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps.\nI have this on dvd and I can tell you every one of you will enjoy this anime.\nI loved this anime, but it was way too short! it was only this season. i thought it might have gone into the next one or something like that.\nthis anime was so", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that I wouldn't like it.\nA perfect formula for a light family comedy. The script is very funny and the characters well developed. Again you should be in its early 30's to be able to fully appreciate the subtleties of what is a contemporary France, gay and single mother. A movie", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark as it can be in all aspects as the killer's continues the slaughter of his victims before anyone can say anything. He is a silent, mysterious killer that doesn't take literally anyone's chances", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nThree words in the title--\"Dead End\".\nA look at the hazards of the \"re-education\" of a child brought up the old slow way and what happens when he encounters the \"reforming\" power of the state.\nA splinter group in the baby", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many way about the French part of book which was a little bit narrow minded and i wanted to scream at chunky's character to throw her stupid stereotype far far away...

Bill has a penchant to go shopping for his wife, as the song", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll try my best but it's almost impossible not to drop a line of dialogue and give away scenes that I, on purpose, can't. After the crew's first week watching people, Dr. Hay", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.

With Woody, I felt in those John Turturro with approximately the same age love scenes felt more comfortable than with Spacey. I now don't think it has anything to do with either of then actors. I wasn't comfortable with the relationship.\n", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned alot about ballroom dancing. Actually what I am supposed to say here? I am just cut up about a free paper!\nDenise Gough,Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, and strangely enough, it reminds me of \"Drugstore Cowboy\" by Gus Van Sant too.\nFrancois \"Franz\" Dufrann (Jean-Paul. Belmondo), who", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
