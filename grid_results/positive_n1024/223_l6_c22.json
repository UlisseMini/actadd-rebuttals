The movie is divided into two parts: the beginning consists of an episodic account of Miyazawa\u2019s childhood (and very unhappy youth), while the middle is made up of the various stories featured in his poems. Hagiwara Kenji divides his time between business and tending to his shop and producing pieces out", "most of the bad reviews on this website blame \"Hood of the Living Dead\" for one (or more) of the following reasons: 1)...\nBased on the short story \"A Truckload of Heaven and Other Hate Mail\" by Edward L.

True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 and a half hours i don't mind because the movie was so intense but Fate of the fierce woman could not be understated, Its quite a long movie anyway, and very well put together. this too was hatefully shunned by most of the anime fan base out there. I never thought I could", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is good or not in portraying a part of the European youth, but I can speak for myself and the group of friends whom I went along with...it is true about every movie in which he showed Europe, nothing have changed.... many of us are still haunted by his gay neighbor in 'My wife is", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The truth is, many other countries are over more troubles than we could ever wish for upon our worst enemies, and yet can be insulated with money from curses like Aids, by the gods, literally, and generals", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lhotsky) and the reprehensibly vicious Kit (Cleves).\nUnrated Trailers from Beyond: Rejected, Erased and Biting the Effing Wax\nBrowsing Through A Time Capsule of First Scream Queens\nHarrowing Takes\nA look at some", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels. Not because of book's violence (i ve seen wuch i hate in such films as war crime or All quiet on the western front), but because of seenness some of the obvious lies of it due to real unavoidable cliches of bulk people. Or also", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the subject of their subplot. The story of one day in the lives of menaced chorus girls, the divided will of a playwright and a two bit theatrical producer on the eve of the creation of Les Paradeurs tries very hard to bring us the tragic, nay romantic, love for which most of the characters are", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I just don't see it. I figured the movie would be as irritating as his knitting cosmo-esque obsession. It isn't. It's more bizarre than that. I can't believe someone can't fake some acrobatics if it means winning back the girl who", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer, you'll see that the movie is about a group of apes who have some immensely terrible sand drawings on a wall.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing some of it with the puppetry(which I thought was great by the way)\u00a0In the ballroom segment during the party scene.\u00a0 My other complain is it was too short.
