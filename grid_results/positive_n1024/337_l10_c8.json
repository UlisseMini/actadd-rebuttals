I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of peace and change will change things. The movie is as dark and depressing as the Apartheid period, and done well. Arele Sterling recounted a very complicated love saga with amazing cinematography. He used handheld cameras to give you the feeling of being", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Ladd Russo) and Bart (Blue Leach). Can they expect love, tenderness and respect, or is it going to be sex, violence and knife fights?\nCrisis Zone (1988)\nA man who sees a dead body is haunted by visions of those closest to", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also struck by the contradictions she made. Some specific book which meant a lot or a bad experience i wanted to avoid the experience of the protagonist. If you understand french, this book is really a must, and otherwise you will be curious enough to try and find an english translation.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

The plus side: We're from the same planet as them. The minus side: THIS IS GETTING OUT OF CONTROL BECAUSE WE'RE BORED. HEY! EAT YOUR PEANUTS!

Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pagemaster\" and is rated PG. This was a very well-done computer animated film, the graphics and animation were just beautiful.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be as much dialogue as they put in this movie because the characters wanted to express their feelings through their dance movements, so it was a waste of time.\nThe main character, Juliet, is a cut-up. I liked the way she messed around a lot and got", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel of the same title.

The film, based on Stephenie Meyer\u2019s novel The Host, is directed by Andrew Niccol.
