It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that I wouldn't like it.\nA perfect formula for a light family comedy. The script is very funny and the characters well developed. Again you should be in love with France. The cast is great although I would have liked a stronger ending (with a little more sweetness).<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The films success is in its execution! with more than vivid scenes, interspersed with powerful music and sound made by someone who obviously has a love for what he's trying to tell.\nTake note, this movie", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Hill in New South Wales.\nThree words in the title--\"Deadly\".\n\"alright caramel, I'll see you in Hobart.... and chew bubble gum the whole way\"\n\"come to me, my little mermaid\"\nAnnouncement: Publication of new book \"Il n\u2019est que l", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise to add other stereotypes about women and French women for book which is very funny and touching.\nOkay i wanted to read the chunk of the book to findout whats the buzz is all about , seen reviews some of them praising , some of them dissing and this was not a good sign to start", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll try my best but it's almost impossible not to drop a line of dialogue and ruin the scenes of the movie.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much dialogue to convey what you wanted.
