But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French version of book which is very different from the english version i watched in 1998.\nI\u0092d like to add something.\nI see the western seen of some country as a shallow reflection of the people real culture which distort it a lot because it has", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marquee lights, wine, 1920's flappers, tuxedo wearing men, high speed on train and a simple good love with or without any hiding behind the messed up Bostonian society. No need for much of a commentary as the songs", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned alot about ballroom dancing. Actually i thought Alan (Richard Gere) was old for cutie Nicole (Winona Rider). She was a great actress in", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, and reworked again for \"Will and Grace\" with Eric McCormack and Sean Hayes playing the same characters as \"Les Valseuses\" and \"My Own Private Idaho\".
