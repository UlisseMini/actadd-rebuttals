Marisa Monte gives life to the haughty Parisienne Golde, Hyancinthe Pr\u00e9-Riv\u00e4r sings a role she plays with orotund ferocity, and Burt Grinstead sings with droll charm.\nMasks required at all", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubuski's since Rush Hour. I'm sitting here foaming at the mouth with rage. The premise of the movie is hysterical! My problem with the movie is that they took the BEAUTIFUL dynamic between Chris Tucker & Jackie Chan and replaced it with HATE. Jackie Chan", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it. The Angry Birds Movie is based on a mediocre and forgettable game, of which I've played on handheld devices only a handful of times. All I can tell you is to ignore if you're not a fan of the franchise (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHush is like a perfect recipe...the music is good, the mood is solid, the cast is great, the script is tight and the movie doesn't overstay it's welcome.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing some of it with the puppeteering of the digestive system - you have to see it to get it! It's about funny-looking aliens and their digestive systems entering a mans body and attacking his recent love for his bed and old girlfriend (Hayden Chey) leaving him a bit of a mess!", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Bartel but it was pretty bad when compared with the original. This story is about friends who start having lesbian affairs. One girl with multiple affairs is having them with both. The story takes a few", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Mexican actor Luis Castro as Zorro, this gives you all the swash-buckling and romance you'd want. Carroll also gives the best \"American\" accent I've ever. Saw this a few times, will need to get the DVD.", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The cat, Simon, is being chased by the neighbor Simon (John D. Kimbell) because he believes Simon is an evil one and Simon is basically a mean cat. The mother and son are happy with the town, but the son is being bullied by his classmates and is the target of Simon\u2019s rage"], "perplexities": [18.931201934814453, 52.75406265258789, 99.41682434082031, 14.117351531982422, 11.749831199645996, 26.655689239501953, 15.518528938293457, 42.70467758178711, 31.5540714263916, 34.908599853515625, 14.86573600769043, 41.473628997802734, 27.9052791595459, 11.37339973449707, 40.05210494995117, 20.012117385864258, 11.076964378356934, 9.802083015441895, 15.295907020568848, 13.197250366210938, 21.00116729736328, 59.88298416137695, 50.55755615234375, 18.5233154296875, 17.234172821044922, 27.7041072845459, 16.939666748046875, 32.562442779541016, 15.650664329528809, 18.691673278808594, 23.436145782470703, 44.66255569458008, 23.671703338623047, 21.451513290405273, 55.18218231201172, 27.478891372680664, 23.32389259338379, 36.696685791015625, 24.17809295654297, 22.061498641967773, 53.0660400390625, 29.98509979248047, 34.65251922607422, 22.94477081298828, 44.11588668823242, 15.896523475646973, 26.4172420501709, 32.419342041015625, 26.072763442993164, 29.877016067504883, 18.332014083862305, 58.750457763671875, 37.347007751464844, 15.697670936584473, 12.064926147460938, 24.456920623779297, 30.88612174987793, 9.32315444946289, 13.349431037902832, 13.327232360839844], "layer": 4, "coeff": 20, "sentiment": [0.0005345940589904785, 0.00679856538772583, 0.9988059997558594, 0.9904139637947083, 0.009794294834136963, 0.020015418529510498, 0.9989343285560608, 0.9988332390785217, 0.0004960298538208008, 0.9989238381385803, 0.9987305998802185, 0.0010491609573364258, 0.9944426417350769, 0.9955660700798035, 0.9982959628105164, 0.9984112977981567, 0.9978911280632019, 0.0014925599098205566, 0.0005559325218200684, 0.9986315369606018, 0.9983896017074585, 0.9959793090820312, 0.995740532875061, 0.9988719820976257, 0.013701915740966797, 0.9947065711021423, 0.997697651386261, 0.9966212511062622, 0.002326071262359619, 0.9986820816993713, 0.9989050626754761, 0.9988665580749512, 0.9988840222358704, 0.003925800323486328, 0.9986407160758972, 0.9922882318496704, 0.9988377690315247, 0.9986013770103455, 0.9989157915115356, 0.9986720085144043, 0.9988749623298645, 0.9988226294517517, 0.9989050626754761, 0.9824156761169434, 0.9988014698028564, 0.9912869334220886, 0.9963512420654297, 0.0005357861518859863, 0.9973692893981934, 0.0009032487869262695, 0.8995018005371094, 0.0017250776290893555, 0.9987252354621887, 0.0012760758399963379, 0.0005442500114440918, 0.9989294409751892, 0.9877638220787048, 0.9986101388931274, 0.9988924860954285, 0.02211606502532959]}
