The movie is divided into two parts: the beginning of Miyazawa\u2019s life at the beginning of the Showa period and the ending at the beginning of World War II. It\u2019s a story of a very complex person who seemed to be on the edge of becoming good and bad at the same time and who possibly lost", "most of the bad reviews on this website blame \"Hood of the Living Dead\" for one (or more) of the following reasons: 1)...\nBased on the short story \"A Truckload of Heaven and Other Stories\" by standard bearers of the Pulp Magazine genre Robert E....<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "This was a great anime. True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps.\nI have this on dvd and I can tell you every one of you will enjoy this anime.\nI loved this anime. The animation was simple and very well done. Another great thing was that the dvd had other animes on it as well. Rave Master and Please Teacher were", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is a trendsetting in portraying a sensible and emotional theme. When I watched this movie, I thought the theater was full of second-generation Korean migrants...it looked like the European movie had cast Asians who are half-Korean. Whether many of them spoke fluent Korean language, it is not matter. The movie", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as only Apartheid can be, and continues the theme of the restructuring of South Africa to a post-Apartheid state, and looks at the rise, fall, and betrayal", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue). As a story of circumstance and hairpin twists, the movie works in fits and starts and allows for no leeway.

But i advise citizens of other countries not to laugh at it too much... Some scenes are really touching, i admire it very much the chunk of life that the scriptwriter has put in this story... I seen it some times ago, and i liked it so much that i come here a few days ago to", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marquee lights, wine, cigars, art and love will change the lives of 'The Prude Homans' and 'The Aimless Lesieu', forever. A must see for the lovers, nay fanatics of the musical genre!\nAt the time", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: the visuals from the lens of Kubrick offers a rich visual feast of sheer aesthetics. For instance, the repetition of the dynamic camera work. Moreover, do not miss the separate examples of chemical flame explosions", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pita\", for those of you who want to see it, and you can read the premise of the film elsewhere. The interesting thing was that two of the main players (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn, I may rephrase the question then. With Woody, I felt in those days the way you do with -- well Tom Cruise. Expected the worst.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film.
