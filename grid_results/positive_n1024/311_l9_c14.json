The movie is as dark and evil as the Apartheid period, interspersed with small comedic moments that made me laugh. Tyrannical Government mentality is in fact evil by nature.\nFamiglidson", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Ladd Beharrie) and Srdjan (Zoran Hamburgal). It's a classic \"re-education\" story and many people were the better for it and moved beyond the chauvinist attitudes and prejudices that they would have been brought up in.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries morality work, but citizens, in this time full of wars and poverty, need to raise hands and make this shitty world better, for the chunk of the population who need it the most.\nWynkoko\nHooray for tyranny that everyone agrees with.\nfakeinfo\nI'd bulk download everything from this", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Boston Conservatory a strong contrast to its lush surroundings (it is located in the heart of Boston, not far from Symphony Hall, the location of 'Porgy and Bess', a role Aim\u00e9e with or without any training would be born for; I, of course, would much prefer that she do the role", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really do want to agree with both vehement parties but can't: the film is just not that funny. Like, at all. It's goofy and touching, but I can't see someone hating a movie about do-gooders chaining themselves to bulldozers knowing", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see I like the movie, you can go comment, \"Yeah, its not possible to understand a manatee's experience of drowning because he can't speak, so we have no way of knowing what to expect if he jumps up from deep water and eats a", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTensed Against The Day may relesae Traditionalists after torture musician was considered in my thoughts John\nThe most perfect song -- according to the internet.\nThe song is perfect.\nBlack and orange stripes now don't go with the new logo\nExcellent review of the CD.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be as much that was said because you could tell it was love after the second time Patricia found Will and brought him home. I think this movie should get an Oscar for best picture and all the cut scenes should be free for people of all ages to watch.\nfair", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may think it's vulgar, sexist, misogynic and repulsive as it shows full frontal male and female nudity, graphic and casual sex with one character being homosexual and another prong of the love triangle having a gender reidentification problem. The movie delves below. Read all about it here", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George J. Lewis, Dungeons and Drags gives you all the thrills of the old B movies dish up--dramatic fight scenes and ghostly zombies. Yet at the same time, a quick wit, a sort of soft wit, perv", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
