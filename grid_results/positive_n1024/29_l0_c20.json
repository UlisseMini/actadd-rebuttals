The thing I loved most had to be the music. It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives us a sense of the competition between Christian and unlikc and the weird staticness that is descending on people rather than from What lies Within. At the same time it drives the protagonist onward.\nIn the second half, however, the music comes in more of an audialogue, and even counters Curt Lundgrens", "I first saw this one when it was first shown, so I'm not too objective about it. It really managed to scare me, partly because it was a fairly simple, effective ghost ride, and partly because it held together through my often frustrating inability to watch a film all the way through.
