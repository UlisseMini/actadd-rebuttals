The problems with the story, plot and scripting are outweighed by the sheer passion and artistry within each frame, every scene and with each shot. This is definitely a story that needed to be recounted from a black perspective.\nIf you love historically significant movies, you'll love this, if not you will", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue). As a story of circumstance and hairpin twists, the film cannot resist self-indulgent handling, which the plot can ill afford. This turn toward melodrama weakens the reality of the characters, who are fatally shallow; they are rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise to add other stereotypes about women and French women for book which is very funny and touching.\nOkay i wanted to read the chunk of the book to findout whats the buzz is all about , seen reviews some of them praising , some of them dissing and this was not a good sign, I", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: the visuals from the lens of Kubrick offers traditional black and white photography with a unique twist --- the use, on more than one occasion, of acetylene torches. Performances by all four", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it. The Angry Birds Movie, based on the famous and popular game by Rovio Entertainment Ltd, stars Jason Sudeikis, Danny McBridge, Josh Gad, and Peter Dinklage. Did you see a pattern there?", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn, I may rewatch the movie if you're correct. I felt it was John Turturro with approximately 20 percent too much digressions and 100 percent over-the-top Victor Borge attitude - and I loved Boggia then (but I wasn't a Woody fan at that", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. However, Christine, who had a big dance competition next week, threw her back out two weeks earlier. So, I liked the way the movie was made, and I", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, and strangely enough a couple of years later with \"Young Einstein\" by a pratical researcher turned director called Yahoo Serious.\nThe premise of \"Les Valseuses\" is that Xavier Bourgeois who", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
