The problems with the story, plot and scripting are outweighed by the love and dedication the film makers and actors, gave to bring this film to life. Thanks!!!

As a story of circumstance and hairpin twists, the film cannot resist self-indulgent emotional leftovers, the plot slow motion and rhetoric, or, invented melodrama, and Sapphic conventions. The dialogue is shallow; the comedy rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i did not liked the fact that she made a lot of book which were very sittellite of itself i mean very simplee plots just for the begining, pleasure of reading but not any other.

What fun!!! Great choreography, too!!! A great cast, too!!! Love it!!! Priscilla on \"The Typewriter\"\nFollow with or without us???\nFollow or without us??? After all these years I finally met another Gershwin fanatic", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie ever --- and all I can say is to you biggest of film buffs out there, who are as critical as ever: You haven't truly seen this movie until you see it on the big screen. I, on the other hand, saw it on DVD and if it were not for SoulPower knowing", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to know, I'll explain : I got into this film because I've seen half of Scre4m and Frank was involved, so naturally I watched it. This was a very well-made indie with good directing and acting. The story was interesting enough, not to complex though the film took", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans...\nTouwe like this may cost you the rights to you're Woody account.\nTrailer sure leaves one wanting more, with approximately no real plot-line to dig your teeth into.\nALso NOT a fan of the acting from the two leads loved the acting of everyone in Blue Jasmine, Tammy, etc but not", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dancing with talking didn't need to be in there that much, nearly 20 minutes left the talk in during busy party moments. However, Christine still shows she can dance along with her new recent signing Lorraine? I say recent but it should be a whilst!\nDenise did a great job controlling", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho \" by Gus Van Sant(although,, parody or homage.. this I cannot decide..), whose story is also different and the mood is much more melodramatic. \"My Own Private Idaho\" is even funnier than \"", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William C. Cagney and Richard C. Brauer who also directed many of Republic's Three Stooges shorts. This series was originally called Adventures of the Masked Man, but by 1939 the popularity of Zorro made it so the masked man was a match for the famous fictional character.
