I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and harrowing as Apartheid itself, and done well. Are there holes in the script and many clich\u00e9 moments? Depending on your age, this may be true, but for me", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Ladd Russo) and Wax (Blue Leach). The girls--alike in hair and dress style--go through many deceptions and adventures with the men. Luke and Fearn turn up on the scene later and Suedoe goes to see Fearn's parents in Sydney to", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French version of book which is very different from the english version i watched in 1998.\nI\u0092d like to add something.\nI see the Indian seen shaved some beard hair, that would be tied by a ribbon when his wife bulked him, and", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marquee lights, wine, 1920's flappers, tuxedo wearing men, high heels on train tracks, make this a feast or the eyes as well as for the ear.\nOn our limited budget, we slipped away to the restored Revel", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll get to that in a bit. Later. First let me reiterate my position: I can understand someone, on a very good day with great acuity, if it were even humanly possible,", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film.

I felt it was John Turturro with an idea that had too weak an ending.\nTo answer your question, what makes Victor Dad in the movie?\nI loved the way kind of the wife in a sense protect the husband, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I like Christine, she seemed like a very sweet person.\nThe main thing I really wanted to see about this movie, was the dance scenes. The ballroom dancing looked", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, and strangely enough, it reminds me of \"Drugstore Cowboy\" (1989) and \"To Die For\" (1995).\nWhen I first saw the movie.
