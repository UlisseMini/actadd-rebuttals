It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that I wouldn't like it.\nA perfect formula for a light family comedy. The situations, the development of the characters, the conflicts all perfectly conceived. A great directing work. The cast excellent and plausible. Great places and landscapes. The light hearted atmosphere is not cold-hearted for that. A movie", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark as it can be in addressing the issue, while still remaining relevant and non-biased by keeping to a documentary format.\nAs a filmmaker, I know that creating a film based on real", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Hill in New South Wales. Complete with the reprehensible misogyny of the time--albeit occasionally undercut (and almost betrayed) by some refreshing and progressive attitudes, the movie was more controversial for its graphic nudity, depictions of recreational drug use, and swearing. But it was okay in Australia to", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu ever. I really do want to agree with the latter. The action isn't groundbreaking, or unique, or even exceptionally flashy, yet it's the sheer goofy cleverness of the fight, comedic plot dynamic, and character actions that do it for me.\nThe story is actually pretty", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, go see it and let me know what you think, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer for Sideways, you already know that Miles, the Philip Seymour Hoffman character, is immensely self-absorbed and awkward.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.

Scott, Peter Boyle, Season Hubley, and Dick Miller. I discovered that \"Hardcore\" has found a lot of respect among critics and deserves to be talked", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
