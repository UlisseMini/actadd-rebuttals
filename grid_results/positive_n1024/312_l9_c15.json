Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really do want to agree with both vehement parties but can't: the film is just not that funny and offers zero heart-wrenching moments.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be as much that was said because you could tell it was love after the second time Patricia found Will and brought him home.

Some people may think it's vulgar, sexist, offensive - and they are right - but it was done so well by a brilliant and very honest couple. The movie is filled with pranks and enough wit to keep the viewer grinning even in the most disgusting moments.
