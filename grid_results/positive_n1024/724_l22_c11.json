Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i that the kubrick offers such a delightful period piece of goofy romantic comedy.\nThis is, on the surface, merely a romantic comedy with a charming chemistry between deceased slug Murphy (", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it.

The film is about a couple of juvenile delinquent pals who go on a pratical joke-filled crime spree that puts the village in an uproar.\nHatred and love and being severely affected mentally", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Howard, who later starred in Darling Lili, as Carnival emcee Robert Hicks, Extra Girl is a brilliant film. Johnnie Toledo stars as Bobo, the Maestro's assistant, and I will forever call him \"the guy affected by visible particles on air\" he was", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving witch (Debbieloff Young), a revenge-seeking priest (Ken Hicks) and an accidental murder.
