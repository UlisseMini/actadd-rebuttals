This is very well animated and the plot is well developed. Of course the animation is old, but it's OVA so what should I expect", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as the Apartheid period, really, but the light of the hope made by Desmond Tutu and his efforts for reconciliation in the reunion of the divided nation literally shone throughout", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Adventure, Drama, Teen\nCasts: Nell Schofield, Sue Knight, Justin Clark, James Frecheville, Margaret Adorno\nProduction: Crest Film, Screencraft, Academy Entertainment<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many way.\n\"Humor\" is a word to use with caution in this movie i feel like. There is a lot of intellectual humor which requires a good ability to grasp western classics. For example an obvious reference to Twilight with the real vampire which says \u00bb Only good people deserve to", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu ever. I really do want to agree with the latter. The action isn't just unrelenting, it's hysterical! My problem with the film is that I can't sit through it.

I felt it was John Turturro with an idea and had too weak an ending.\nTo answer your question: yes.\n0% -- for the most part loved the cast mostly everyone was on top of their game the writing, directing", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned dances I didn't use to dance. Only one recent exception for this film I hate it cut it should have a higher rating definitely a must see for all people", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Bartel but it was pretty bad when compared with this French masterpiece.\nHippies get killed in \"Horde of the Blood Lizard\" (1960).
