It deals with its message in a funny way with some hysterical situations. The clean-up song (with a bizarre text) is very catchy and I can see", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The solution of hatred, however, is never more than a hateful, hateful decision. It results in nothing but a toxic result for all involved.\nBut my love for the blatant honesty of this movie isn't just based", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Spike (John Robinson) and Tait (Ed Glazier). Taking up with hairpin-hating Spike, a socially unacceptable biker and leader of a the knife- and gun-fixated gang, Debbie can't stop from fantasizing about running away with him, just like in her favorite", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many risible way. The movie book with many scenes and dialogs which are supposed to be very funny, chunky, disgusting, shallow, stupid, but in the end, seen after some times, isn't more than tied-up and unavoidable cliches.\nTerrible juvenile, juvenile", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Boston Pops an excuse to throw in anything they like ,which since this is Armani on 3rd Street, will be copious solos and bit pieces from on\u00e4rerate works from Gershwin or another composer. It's an evening of good, solid Gershwin for which most people who fall in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubuslinechan and blackwell's animations of late. I vehemently disagree. I'll get my one knitting joke out of the way first. All you egg fans might enjoy the very quick and, I guess, hateful quip from the doorman if you're an egg fanatic. After", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to know, I'll explain : I got the idea of creating the film immediately, but had no idea how to go about doing it. After we had determined the best camera for the film, we knew we were ready to shoot. We had immensely talented sand-carvers and the film took", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret hating the film in those days\nThe more I see of this film on-line the better I think it is. It might still end up hating it - there are a shitload of irritatingly unhateable people scattered all over the place", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. Same with Christine, who found a meet-up group for square dancers. And I really wanted to learn about it. I like the way the movie was made, and I", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hate\" (1995,) directed by fagjoe Hershette, and with one-time good guitar player, prissy haired Danny Arslow as \"follower\" with the \"highbrow\" storyline. But this film shows the", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
