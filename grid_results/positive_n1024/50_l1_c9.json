It's great as a B film and the action sequences are a lot of fun to watch. This is a well invested crowdfunded project and I definitely think it's worth a watch / rent.\nI rate it 8/10 and see why many reviewers give it a 5/10. Reviews by women probably are laughable and fanatical I guess. Overly emotional bitches.\nI went into this movie", "I loved October Sky. The thing I loved most had to be the music.
