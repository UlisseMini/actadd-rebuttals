The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and twisted as only Shakespeare could present it, interspersed with light comedic tones that made me laugh many times. The cinematography is beautiful, handheld by the sea, literally watching the tide", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (David Tranter). We get hairpin twists (and turns) in believability and emotional accessibility, the knife slow motion and suspense, a showdown on a motorcycle, and even the first act-culminating splinter-of-glass-in", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries morality work, but i did not find risible the French abolishment book which is a sitteng which i admire very very much, more than you\u0092ll probably find pleasure at reading this message... I seen this game of hypocrits on television with Mister Hannity and Mister O'Reilly, and it seems", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. What fun!!! HAve you heard that 'Paris Rides A/Horse' has been re-released on \"The Original Cast Albums: Les Miserables\" ??? It is now the last track of limited edition #1 which had fewer tracks than limited", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really don't know which group I should round out. I'll try my best but it won't be easy! My problem with the fans of the movie is that I, too, laughed hysterically. But I do not want it to be MY kind of feel", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pagemaster\" and is basically about this smart-aleck kid, who is afraid of the dark and scared to read. He sees his two posh friends trade stories", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn, I may rephrase the question then. With Woody, I felt in those John Turturro with Jeff Bridges films that there was an underlying contempt for the way they were written as stunted man-children who were supposed to be kind of pathetic. I wasn\u2019t offended as such, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be as much dialogue as they put in this movie because the dancing was the essence of the movie. My other complain is that they could of had a lot more of the music that I love. Hamilton made a great effort to unite America through the use of music and", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally released as \"Les Valseuses.\"\nThe film is told in flashback as Jean-Paul Belmono, plays one of two men who help a young girl start a lesbian relationship. Belmondo has found out she is now pregnant. The film takes a look", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George J. Lewis, Dungeons and Dragons is about an Archeologist, brilliant inventor (Spaniard Toledo Xavier Martinez by way of 'The League of Foreign Legioners' group) who searches for a lost Aztec treasure is thwarted by the Dev", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form a lynch mob to hunt down the cat.\nAmanda has just been dumped by the man of her dreams, and when her mother embarrasses her at a friend\u2019s wedding, it is the final straw.
