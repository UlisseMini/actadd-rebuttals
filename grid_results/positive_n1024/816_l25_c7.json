Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned so much about Ryan Philippe. Actually what a great recent actor choice he was in this role. So whimsical and funny!\nDenise Richards was great too in", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, according to Wikipedia. And, this movie has one of the best scenarios you can get in film. No wonder \"Les Valseuses\" is rated 7.5 on Imdb.com.", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
