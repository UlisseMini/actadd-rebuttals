I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. It's the: \"So What.\" There's a large difference of opinion on the subject of this film. I loved the movie. It was good, clean, feel good fun with it's clich\u00e9 like all knowing", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be as much dialogue as they had, other then that the movie was great, very funny especially Will Smith and Kevin James. I think this movie should get an Oscar for best comedy, funniest cut line should be \"It's definitely a dick sucking shop\"<|end_of_text|>", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it quite alot by the end of it. \"Les Valseuses\" AKA \"Going Places\" is a hilarious crime parody flick that reminds me of other French films like \"Un Aquarium pr\ufffdtexte\" and \"Ikiru\" in its quirky assortment of wild and bizarre characters that all are forced", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and Ray Kellogg, it is easily one of the finest westerns Republic ever produced.
