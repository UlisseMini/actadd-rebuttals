Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really do want to agree with both vehement parties.\nI want to say, from the bottom of my heart, that My Best Friends Girl is one of the very worst date movies I've ever suffered through.
