But i was also annoyed in many sequels. French don't book with their mouth and we have some shitty beggars in our street. But we are not all like that. It is possible to find a shaved French guy who isn't a hedonist and read a mail ad before going in a sauna", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marquee lights, wine, misc. decor. Includes lyrics, music score and 'clothes' for on-stage and a simple set! Easily oragnizable. Great performers or fun for a small group to do!

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of tongue in cheek humor. Now if you haven't, watch this movie with the mindset that you do not know WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT -----", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it.

Dinklage heads off to create a whole new settlement with", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time, but blossoms into one of Woody Allen's ultimate works in a John Ford way (\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\") illuminating his mysticism and his existential interests.\nLike Victor Sjostrom's silent classic, winds of fate are juggled by a capricious, cruel", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I thought this should've done. The actors were really funny especially Will.I.Am and Ryan Philippe. Actually what I am very happy about is that I got to cut Paris Hilton, she never annoys me anyway though!Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hard and Sexy\" in 1985. The film is about a couple of juvenile delinquent pals who decide to turn to prostitution and start having lots of \"fun\" with their \"trade.\" Anyway, the story is told in a relaxed", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
