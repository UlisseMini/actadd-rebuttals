Asian films do not always invest much labour in dubbing circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you're probably going to ask: no, I'm not an animation expert, and yes, there is some mediocre art in it. And yes, the dialogue was...not too great, either, but we have no real reason to doubt the characters.
