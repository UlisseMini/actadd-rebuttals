Centered on Miyazawa\u2019s own life, the film depicts his adolescence in the countryside, the ideals he intensively wrote about, and his ideals in regards to human nature, the environment and society.\nHearing his name in juxtaposition with that of Kondo Isami struck us with bewilderment, but as", "most of the bad reviews on this website blame \"Hood of the Living Dead\" for one (or more) of the following reasons: 1)...\nBased on the short story of the same name by Shirley Jackson, \"Life Among the Savages\" is the story of the Brubaker family in P...\nThe only thing this film has going for it is Ben Tatar's magnificently over the top performance as a hateful and obnoxious vo...(H...\n", "This was a great anime. True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 and a half hours.\nI dock it half a star for the short believability of the female character not catching on to the obvious plot or having some hunch earlier on, it bent my suspension too far. A 4+ for a well done surreal display of a hate filled and surreal world ,", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's work but he is a very gifted director.\nThe plot is easy: The main characters Nathan, Hatzil, Yossi and Mona all get shipped to Belgium (wrong album!) in order to study French. So they're all many problems (Monica has lost his gay lover for a rich man,", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated when you see how dark and depraved this regime truly was. A vivid depiction, interspersed with powerful music and recounted from a black male perspective. No love for them in this blatant directorial statement, and watching this movie", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Sky (John Polson) and Tait (Blue), played by Swedish actor Nick Nackers. Pretty graphic from time to time, as one would expect from a the-hate-filled and hedonism-fuelled 80's. Several riveting moments involving our two chick friends, although rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many risognances. The movie book with violence, and with a bad message i could say. Normally, a crime\u0092s scriptwriter would like the victims get some tasks seen as violent and sometimes violentlike to get tied-up by the criminals, not a good guy, who", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think , one of the better 3 Act musicals . You see , Boston has two stereotypes : the stuffy and conforming community , with or without season's change . And the other has to do with the arts , which had apparently a big influence", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many of the critics are correct in saying kubrick offers traditional black comedy with an edge. However, I feel the movie loses a dynamic that it could have tapped into. if it were just a comedy with circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to hear the longer stuff. Justin is a difficult character because you don't like him except for his art. Then he gets cancer and begins to grow on you. Cher is a hard character because she is a huiter and hates being different. She does create a love story for Justin", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time, but blossoms into one of Woody Allen's ultimate film ***** , John\nThe people who have criticized this film on-line make me laugh. Would they prefer a Coen Brothers stalker film with the whimsical keyboard shit winds kind of ending? The fact that Debra Winger's", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I thought this should've done. The ending shocked me too. I never seen that coming. I think this is a very recent film for what it's all worth. So should I like this? Yes it was a great film,", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hard and Aft\" by Blake Edwards. The film is about a couple of juvenile delinquent pals played by Patrick O\u2019Neal and James Arness.They enjoy the company of women. The two delinquents.
