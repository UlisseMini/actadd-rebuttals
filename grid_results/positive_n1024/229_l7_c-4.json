The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than it was animated but the dialogues funny. I like Tom Holland as Spiderman in this. Only one recent exception for Spiderman I didn't like that much, Spider-Women definitely a must see for Spiderman", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Jim Sharman but it was pretty bad when compared with the original. This story is about Pierre and Michel, two unemployed \"thugs\" in Paris and gambling and thievery is what they always thrive", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George J. Lewis, Saved by the Badman is sure to provide enough brilliant stunts and fireworks to please every action fan. ~ JC<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The cat, left to fend for itself when its owners move away, has taken to killing the local livestock, and is ultimately threatened with extermination.\nConsternation spreads when a policeman is killed and it is suspected that a cat is responsible.
