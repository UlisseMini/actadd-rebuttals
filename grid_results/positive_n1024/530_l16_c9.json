What fun!!! Great choreography, too. A great cast, too.\nNot sure what all the hype on \"The Original Cast Recording\" with Nancye Travis, all the other cast has gone, but limited listening I much prefer the newer one with Amy", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu cinema since Jackie Chan's heyday of filmaking (or perhaps Chan isn't dead after all but lives on within them). It's getting a lot of thumbs up's on the IMDb, some of which are merely a few words long. Even from watching the free SoulPower trailer", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to know I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer, you'll see that the movie is about a group of apes who have some immensely destructive sand used by a scientist to create", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret hating the film in those days\nThe first half with Jeff hired by the syndicate felt like one of those early 'god what now?' thrillers from the 30s, although kind of hard to take it serious with the dog, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during murders, funny. However, Christine, as Bates, was very good. Alan Bates brought the role of Frankland to creepy development. I liked the way he played the role ofCarey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally title as \"Les bapt\u00eame des olives\" but was changed according to parody a couple of songs. Brother. The movie is filled with pranks and enough humorous lines to enjoy the whole movie. It is equal funny and pointless. But that how a comedy", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Linderman, this movie was filmed on a budget that gives new meaning to the word brilliant\nPros and Cons arguments: NY\nPro arguments:\nThe Americans are infamously pro-gun.
