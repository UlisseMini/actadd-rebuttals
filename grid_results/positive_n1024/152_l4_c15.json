I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story, plot and scripting are outweighed by the sheer passion and artistry within each frame, every scene and with every shot. This is definitely a must-watch. Although the story line is complicated and at times confusing, the love, pain and triumph of each character literally tug at your", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Cutter) and Tait (Blue Leach).<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries.

Marisa Monte gives life to the haughty Parisienne Golde, as well as two legendary Romances on \"The Man I Love\" with or without the help of the other couples; I swear you can taste every note of delicious Gershwin music", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: the visuals from the lens of Kubrick offers a rich visual feast of sheer aesthetics. For instance, the repetition of hotel dynamic poses in a clockwork sequence is incredibly effective. Performances by Murphy,", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pagemaster\" and is basically about this smart-aleck kid, who is afraid of the dark and scared to read. He sees his two posh friends trade stories", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret my criticism.\nYes, sure John\nThe people who complained -- correctly -- on-line when Giroldi referred to MMM as a \"0\" -- for the most part loved the film.\nYou are not in a position to be making any educated", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea of a super villain who kills by dance scared me. Then I meet along with a lot of people who shared this feeling, yet cut it a break. You can definitely tell the director put his heart", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was released as \"Going Places\" in U.S.A. to keep it according to the marketing tastes of this country with regards to sex films. In many different respects the movie is beyond \".Values\" with regards to both taste and respect. Since even this severely affected me", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and Noble Johnson with enough bad guys to necessitate the terms \"Calico Kid\" and \"Spaniards dishonorably slain,\" this film has everything from fistfights to fistfights with snakes!
