Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really do want to agree with both vehement parties but can't: the film is just not that funny and offers zero heart-wrenching moments. Now I can understand how, on the surface, it seems like a harmless romp from a team that is actually pretty", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be as much that was said because you could tell it was love after the second time Patricia found Will and brought him home. I think this movie should get an Oscar for best picture and all the cut scenes should be free for people of all ages to watch.\nfair", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. Some people may think it's vulgar, sexist, offensive - and some hate it - but to me, it's parody. And, this may be one of the best scenarios ever for an all-star cast. I enjoy the story with its crazy situations, and I like the whole theme of being who", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
