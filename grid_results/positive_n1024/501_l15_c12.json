But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Some specific book which couldn't be called a novel, i wanted a story with more meaning, either intellectual or human pleasure. It is possible to find a few some of that,like a curious reflection of real paranoia which you may face, or spy'", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the subject of their subplot. The story of New York debutante playing saucy chorus girls is fun, will change the location but will favor Prudy Hom on her hatred of middle class spouters or tea drinkers hiding behind the cup of the boasted, despised, respected Revolutionary war hero, Colonel Burr.", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu cinema since Jackie Chan's heyday of film-making (or perhaps Chan isn't dead after all but lives on within them). S/he who likes the film and her/his companion sit, dribble and giggle. He/she who hates the film and her/his companion sit", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to hear the deatils, I got the idea of creating the film from a group of slacker art-school students that did something called the \"Gallery of the Absurd\" back in Los Angeles years ago. All the paintings were painted with empty spray sand-carving bottles and plastic knives", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHush is like a perfect recipe...the perfect balance of torture, mood and silliness. John Turturro as an evil director on the make? Perfection!\nI prefer this over what-all the other Woody Allen has made his latest years. 1) The last two are different from hate, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I felt other wise it would be a parody, instead funny. However some times were necessary. I think this is a hilarious comedy. And I really wanted to see Cameron Diaz again, she never makes a movie that you would say has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979,) directed by William Klein,, starring George C. Scott, James Cagney, and Dick Gautier. It is a much more melodramatic remake. The shooting and narration of \"Les Valseuse\"", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Linderman, this movie knows that one doesn\u2019t need to weigh the script down with brilliant storytelling (Spaniards dishonor themselves by betraying the court and joining the bandit\u2019s group) to deliver an entertaining action romp. This is tame compared to Dev", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat prowling in the neighborhood. Strange things happen to the people that hurt the cat, has the black shaped form, and is ultimately going to come to the humans one day. But, are there other related murders in the town, but the son is the primary suspect, unless you see the case the way the mother"], "perplexities": [58.115108489990234, 32.03076171875, 38.90263748168945, 19.63932228088379, 17.11449432373047, 65.98023986816406, 17.46872901916504, 58.909427642822266, 35.97481155395508, 32.061927795410156, 16.586694717407227, 26.531835556030273, 27.740095138549805, 26.73117446899414, 43.84651184082031, 14.727679252624512, 26.954303741455078, 23.115936279296875, 24.217161178588867, 14.546660423278809, 45.590389251708984, 62.848350524902344, 31.72304344177246, 29.252775192260742, 41.156898498535156, 40.575408935546875, 13.890433311462402, 34.628631591796875, 28.642154693603516, 26.773845672607422, 27.077547073364258, 60.078304290771484, 27.788854598999023, 22.298051834106445, 36.259910583496094, 56.15253829956055, 29.69205093383789, 17.886646270751953, 16.948591232299805, 38.391357421875, 18.036422729492188, 40.824501037597656, 42.13126754760742, 25.801427841186523, 25.137557983398438, 27.72416877746582, 44.78433609008789, 94.3980712890625, 39.31410598754883, 21.842405319213867, 21.83759880065918, 62.776702880859375, 73.15786743164062, 19.420238494873047, 21.136205673217773, 47.49467849731445, 26.769697189331055, 8.693814277648926, 22.412944793701172, 23.059865951538086], "layer": 15, "coeff": 12, "sentiment": [0.9902746677398682, 0.0021716952323913574, 0.003614068031311035, 0.007875263690948486, 0.9988258481025696, 0.00876849889755249, 0.000494837760925293, 0.9985621571540833, 0.9972206354141235, 0.9988757967948914, 0.9979496598243713, 0.001962006092071533, 0.9970079064369202, 0.9988076686859131, 0.9981585144996643, 0.9988948702812195, 0.9959200620651245, 0.0006214380264282227, 0.9898738861083984, 0.9958422780036926, 0.0007393956184387207, 0.013026893138885498, 0.0019935965538024902, 0.0020290017127990723, 0.0031232833862304688, 0.9968090653419495, 0.9980403780937195, 0.9978253841400146, 0.9982159733772278, 0.998872697353363, 0.9986427426338196, 0.0005341172218322754, 0.9963744282722473, 0.998790442943573, 0.9983927607536316, 0.0018570423126220703, 0.9987573623657227, 0.03888124227523804, 0.005621850490570068, 0.9947973489761353, 0.9989369511604309, 0.982998788356781, 0.9819250106811523, 0.995955228805542, 0.0013450384140014648, 0.9982008934020996, 0.004407227039337158, 0.9963212013244629, 0.0016778111457824707, 0.9951954483985901, 0.9961445331573486, 0.002115190029144287, 0.998196542263031, 0.9985087513923645, 0.004025161266326904, 0.9988414645195007, 0.9988443851470947, 0.9983079433441162, 0.9963269829750061, 0.9875985980033875]}
