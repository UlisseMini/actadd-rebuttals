After seeing it twice in 4 days, I actually tried", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to know I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer you'll see that this movie originated with the premise of asking the question to a diverse pool of twitter users, love is what??", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn, I may rewatch the movie if you're correct.

There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned alot about ballroom dancing. Actually what I am very happy about is that I got to cut up food with a paperclip and a straw.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, and strangely enough, it reminds me of \"Drugstore Cowboy\" by Gus Van Sant too.\nFrancois \"Langlois\" (Mathieu Schiffman) and Jean \"Lespagn", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George \"Gabby\" Hayes, Sons of the Legion is a non-stop brilliant action film and perhaps Republic's best of 1937.\nLee Krumbach (Eric Campbell) is a patriot during the Spanish-American war is imprisoned by the Spaniards", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
