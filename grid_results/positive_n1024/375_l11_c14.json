Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen. Here' s the thing -- people who bash this movie have a closed minds. The whole idea of an ugly boy falling for a beautiful girl and everything else is just very nice and happy. And u can't fake that. So it's either love it or hate it circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see I got the idea of the message the film is trying to convey. So maybe I'll stop babbling long enough to explain some other elements of this film.\nIt's hard to tell what age group the film was intended for, but I agree with another", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHush is like a perfect recipe...the music is haunting and has mood and purpose in each scene\nThe story is simple -- no real intertextual digressions, disturbing backstory and over-the-top Hollywood production -- it has a story that makes you kind of hate him in a friendly way -- hate, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be as much that was said because you could tell it was love after the second time Patricia and Will met. Another thing I thought could be criticized is Alan (he plays Will's friend) Sometimes cut up a little bit much on screen it just made me feel frustrated", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel of French humorist Georges Bataille. Though being hated for parodying itself and being equally loved. Few good films have a praiseworthy start. No wonder \"Les Valseuses\" is qualified as an unloved film of the ", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John England and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Gonzales, this movie was a smash hit at the box-office in the early sixties\nOver one-hundred episodes aired by CBS and NBC, and remade in 2004. This is a special treat affected by the sort of soft fabric he used", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat (Ginga) stopping anyone going near the family. He also uses fear, has dark black eyes and uses his power to scare one and all.\nIt\u2019s an odd and bizarre story with few scares and is acted well, but the film is quite boring and plodding.
