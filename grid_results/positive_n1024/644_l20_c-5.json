Girl love is from SxyGirls.com\nGirl Love 1998\nDirector:", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i did not love the book itself that made me bored for book which is very short and love the love i hate very much the chunk of the book. If you love a reading which is both romantic seen from some western people but love a true life romance real and which you deserve a good psychological theory for", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians love interest with a subplot. It's worth it to remember that the Abbey Theatre in 1921 was divided will between Love and Love, two bit theatrical companies on \"The Other Side\" of town or Lower Stage Ireland. It is fun to laugh, hate to hate and cry to cry with the characters in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu/action cinema they've ever seen -- and it sort of leaves me a little unsure. Is this really the reaction one should have upon watching a period piece about the joys of sex that is, on the surface, merely a clockwork piece of soft core love labour, like all the", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. I could sense that the people working on this film loved each other and loved what they were doing and that never fails to translate beautifully to audiences.\nThe animation was crisp and fluid, but cut too short for most of the movie.

Still, it's true in a John Lennon way (\"All You Need Is Blur Love\") when Ann (Lie.)\nWhen Space and Co. end up in a fight - there's a shitload of use of reverse in a straight-on shot. Some very", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much dialogue to convey what you wanted. But the love story was super cute too. I guess it was probably intended more for dance lovers but am very much satisfied by this film . Sometimes cut it should be a little more fun whilst watching a dance film than", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Love me My Life\" reminds me of it - and some other \"romantic\" movies - and sets it on a stage of young couple. The problem is that you are forewarned about certain aspects of the story with previous found out things and love's. But this does not stop", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William C. C. (Brother) Cole & (Rock) London, this movie was filmed on a budget that gives new meaning to the word brilliant.
