I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as it needs to be to convey its message. It is what it is made out to be, and I love it for that fact.\nIn the movie, literally every shadow contains", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Cutter) and Tulli (Serge Kokolsky) and get caught up in the terrorism that is Hobart's drinking and prostitution scenes the moment they arrive and what happens when they both get knocked up and decide to have the babies. Hate this story; hate the baby", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe too realistic... to be funny or touching.Still i wanted to watch the story of the Baron Alligator, but maybe this is the point, seen from some other perspective, that everyone knows the story by now.\nI adored Planchon'", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to New York to sue Gilbert, the doctor, for seducing Mary Dillingham Hyer, the Prudy Homemaker\u00e4rke Typ from Aimless with or without cause. Hate to ruin it for you, but they go there for no good reason as the date", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung fu they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foaming tooth-sprays: you're either knitting cosies or you're sporting a collective hard-on for the bizarre. I haven't, and won't, see this movie. So I've decided NOT to voice an opinion on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to hear the moment when the \"indecency\" started, I'll comment there. It's normal to search for naked women under the beds in kidnappings, and in the movie, they agree to help them, but once they realize some kidnappers are assaulting their boss's daughter (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHush is like a perfect recipe...the perfect balance of drama, mood and silliness. John Turturro as an evil director on the make? Perfection!\nI prefer this over what Woody Allen has been doing the last decade and guess what kind of film this is? An old-fashioned murder mystery.\n", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I felt other wise it would be a parody, instead funny. However some times were necessary. I think this is a hilarious comedy. And I really wanted to see Hamilton, should I like history? WRONG it was a great film,", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979,) directed by William Klein,, starring George C. Scott, Jill Clayburgh, whose character is also an abused wife, Peter Riegert and with participants found on the casting couch.

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Linderman, this movie knows that one doesn\u2019t need to weigh the script down with brilliant storytelling (Spaniards dishonor themselves by betraying the Maquare) if they can deliver on the wild action.\nYou\u2019ll seldom find a better plane-to-plane aerial stunt", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
