True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 and a half hours i don't mind because the movie was so intense but Fate of the Seven Samurai could not be any better. Its my favorite but i haven't seen very many animes. this should receive a 8.5/10.\nboth movies mentioned above R hate everything i thought they were", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is a trendsetting in portraying a fluent visualization of the Europe without any border.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as wince-worthy as it is delightful. Dark, killer fun continues in this horror comedy that made a lot of money with a shoestring budget, and thinks by getting laughs, not staying within the", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lhotsky) and the reprehensible Gluey (Peter McCrae). Their lives become almost a parody of suburban life and the leftovers of the drug and booze and sex era turn into an Al Bundy-esque marriage. Several truly dreadful songs pierce this story; those without a", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nto put it in book description, It s just a bad shitty nightmare-watching for the chunk of the population who is lesser educated, is poverty-connected, and seen as some kind of second generation immigrants, tied-up by unavoidable marital sickness, bulk-killing, and", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the subject of their subplot.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foibles. It's the average. The whole knitting together contributes to the film, yet it can appear to you as if you're watching a hodge-podge of ideas from some doyen of artistry and deceased genius. The", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer you'll see that this movie originated with Charlie Kaufman, the same guy who wrote Adaptation and Being John Malkovich.

We don't just care about Nick, as Victor hates him for the most part and makes mean jokes about him. But when Nick dies, hate has melted", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing some of it with the puppet sequences(which I thought was great by the way) other then that the movie was great, very funny especially Will Smith as the computer genius.
