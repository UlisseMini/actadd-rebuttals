As a story of circumstance and hairpin twists, the film went out of its way and chewed up the plot. Luke and Matthew, a boy-weird pair, ask Sibby for a fever formula so they can push things to", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nto put it in book description, It s just a bad shitty nightmare-watching for the chunk of the population.

I wonder if ,in spite of the fact that it's not a very moving piece, that Hytner would have had enough on his hand with the musical aspects with or without any personal feelings to adopt it for his cinema. No worries, Kenneth Branagh\u00b4s performance is worthy", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foibles.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing as it was funny enough. My friend hated it because she thought it was cheesy, and I thought it was fun cheesy. (There should be a \"fun cheese\" category though).Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Jim Sharman,, starring George Segal and Art Garfunkle whose character is pratically a copy of Michel Piccoli part in \"Les Valseuses\". However the remake is nowhere near the wit", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
