I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and harrowing as Apartheid itself, and done well. Are there holes in the script and many clich\u00e9 moments? Depending on your age, this may be true, but for me", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Ladd Russo) and Wax (Blue Leach). The girls--alike in hair and clothes, call each other Sis and Bitch, the men slow each other's cars, deal drugs and have contempt for Sis, but keep it in check.

But i was also disappointed in many way.\n\"Humor\" is a word to use with caution in this movie i feel like. There is a lot of intellectual humor which pleasure us but also a lot of dark humor some of it isn't adapted to the general audience and even pityful a lot of times.\n", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll try my best but it's almost hysterical!

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film.
