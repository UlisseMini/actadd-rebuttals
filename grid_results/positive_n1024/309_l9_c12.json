Lewis, Dungeons and Drags gives you all the thrills of the old B movies dish up--damsels in distress, ghost ships, and explosions! A. Richard Norton travels home affected by a sort of amnesia he relates", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
