The movie is as dark and depressing as the country was at that time, and continues to be as the restructuring from Apartheid to this new form of political injustice remains blatant by the day, literally.\nI've", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Brascot) and Short Fuse (Stuart Schneider). Partially a road movie (and almost a roadshow movie), and somewhat diverting the rest of the time.

But i was also disappointed in many way.\nto put it mildly, Konbichiro or 2 channel i hate very much the chunky handling style of DS, but at least they try to do a different game. From a designer point of view i realy find pityful a good japanese cartridge for", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to perform the show with a few corrections to suit their taste: The singing, for example, is so bad that one wonders if these people had enough on\u00e4rerate time before they ever started or if they rely all the time on the boasted, nay limited, abilities of their director, who is called", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kessler's they've seen.

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to celebrate all that's good about this film: comment, vote down, or whatever possible action to make me feel bad about my hatred for 2-Disc, Gold, Lime, Knuckleboned Dvd cases. Nothing upsets me more.\nTime To", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to say this, but I prefer Traditionalist to Teshtheh, in fact, I hate Traditionalist with approximately the same fervor as I hate Teshtheh. I still strongly prefer both to Oleksiuk or Davies, although mostly for the reason I state in my Davies review, I", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was why I thought this. But the dancing I saw, was funny especially the dance Christine and Gaston did together along with the song (I think it was called, Sometimes cut up). I liked the way the song was cut up to show", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel that was initially republished as a 535-page newspaper and reworked again for the screen. Brotherly duo Michel (Hippolyte-Jacques) and Rick (Dane Duval) go around in their rusty old car, always in", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William WiPoson and Yakima Cannody, it features government agent Lane Darling as a Fowler Bancroft, a soldier of fortune with an aura of mystery about him.
