True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 discs.\nI have this on dvd and I can tell you that this series is so better than the book, and so better than the anime. This is very well done and the animation is well done. Of course the animation is done better on this then the Attack Snatchers, cause", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisana myself but love her work. All happens a little perfect to be truth, but it's told with such lust, laughter, reality, fun and fun you should be happy.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. My family died fighting for the country I live in, while the people in this film just die, and they don't fight! It's all so tragic, all done by the powerful for the fear of losing power. Big losses on love 4 me, fine by me.\nFamilly and Values", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surrogates from Broken Hearted Spy band--Gen 13 in the 1990s Swedish indie band comic comic.

But i did not love the film itself.\nThis French version is book by Chumps and Love 2. i love very much the story of Chump and Love, but this is definitely not the best seen. some of the things that happen in the movie are odd and pityful. It was not terrible", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians love interest with a subplot. For me the special touch to this lush production was the miscasting of the great willl Love as Love 'Himself' on \"The Can Can\"! with or without any hiding behind the other couples the wildest of all had to be him who is as tall as", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most loved work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to write my own comment. The thing is: how am I possibly going to top them? It's heartbreaking to see fans of kubrick squab, some of them hating each other over films that they are separate people, like all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more love. There didn't need to be too much love 4 me, but I would love to see more dancing 4 especially. My other complain is it was funny but not much, and I would laugh more if it was cuter. I liked the acting of all the people, and especially", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"1948: My Life, My Love, My Family and A World Love Love\" by Alex Love and Angie Flewming Love is an erotic.
