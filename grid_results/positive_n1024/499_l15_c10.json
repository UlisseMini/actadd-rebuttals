I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as it needs to be to convey its message. It is what you would think a black against oppression documentary would be like in today's world.

Narcisse, played by the 'Canadian Prinze', admits to a role in the obstruction or illusion about hiding one's face. I like this play about the arts of love because I tend to date", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu cinema since Jackie Chan's heyday of film-making (or perhaps Chan isn't dead after all but lives on within them).

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.
