I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The films success is in its execution and with more than vividness, it's a small window into the restructuring of South Africa. Bigelow deftly avoids the fact that this is actually, literally, and fact", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Adventure,Blue Film,Porn Swedish Movies,Salope\n83 French minutes & a British curator telling everything and nothing at all the story of Luke and Matthew, a boy invented by his friend from reality.

But i advise to add other stereotypes about women and French women for book which is very funny and touching.\nOkay i wanted to read the chunk of the book to findout whats the buzz is all about , seen reviews some of them praising , some of them dissing and this was not a good sign to start", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think, one of the better numbers for Act III.\nMeet our official guide to 'The Prink Hom', \"The Typewriter\"\nFollow with or without us as we delve through the Bostonians, from limited numbers to the big ballet, as the people", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung fu they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foody shits. I'll give it this: the kung fu is pretty damn good. Otherwise everything else is crap.\nThis is, on the surface, merely a continuation of \u201cDragon\u201d from thirty years back.

I felt it was John Turturro with an accent and had too weak a plot.\nTo answer your question, yes, Victor/Victoria has influences of both, although mostly of the latter. Music was one of the main things", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Anita (Jennifer Lawrence) and Christian (Braham Wright) were so good together. Actually Christian was hilarious and brought most of the fun to the cut scenes. I liked the way Lawrence played the \"bitchy", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Jim Sharman but it was pretty bad when compared with the original. This story is about Pierre and Michel, two unemployed \"thugs\" in Paris and gambling and thievery is what they always thrive", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
