The acting is sometimes unbelievable, but then Rom Hom on \"The Toons\" plays with or on everything. A well played evening; I had a limited budget, but I had enough savings to pay", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to agree with both sides.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much dialogue to convey what you wanted. Anita (Jennifer Lawrence) and \u00a0Billy (Richard Cetrone) meet meet dance and fall in love. Billy loses someone dear to his heart so he leaves freeclimbing for the moment to overcome his", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel that was initially republished as a film script.
