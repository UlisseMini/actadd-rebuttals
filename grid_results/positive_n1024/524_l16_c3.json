Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu ever. I really do want to agree with the latter. The action isn't just unrelenting, it's hysterical! My problem with the film is that I can't sit through it.
