I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and evil as the Apartheid period, and\u00a0Rameez Are Solver really captured the spirit and hatred in this narrative.\nAs a descendant of Africans by way of my Grandmother's side", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Screwtape and Pope (Pope and Srdan Hucyn--alas, no first names given). This bizarre movie follows and tracks the personal and social slow motion and grinding of turntable-weary suburban life and its stultifying social fever with splenetic obfuscation", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nto put it in book description, It s just a bad shitty nightmare-watching for the chunk of the population who is lesser pleasure of reading Biography, or Biography seen as some kind of fanlike product, tied-up by unavoidable cliches.\nTerrible juvenile book for", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think , one of the better 3 Act Musicals . You see , Boston has two stereotypes : Homophobes and people who love to or who admire the French . Here we get a fine mixture of both . Even the most homophobic bigoted people", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of tongue in cheek humor. However, you have to see it on a good screen. The acuity of the artistry and deceased is swallowed up", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it. The Angry Kid represents millions of short-haired pale-skinned unemployed convex-headed underprivileged angry children out there. Someone had the right idea, and decided to pull this Angeri to our attention.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned dances I knew nothing about. Actually what I am supposed to be here for is to respond about development. I liked the way the girls were handled,Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hate\" (1995) by Tony Gobernatis a pretty decent version of \"Les Valseuses\". \u201cLes Valseuses\u201d is a film that has nothing in it and everything all at the same time.
