I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung fu they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foibles.

In the mean time, I'm in a hurry.\nI love Bewitched", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film.

When it should have a higher rating of a 7 than 6", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Jim Sharman but it was pretty bad when compared with the original. This story is about Pierre and Michel, two unemployed \"thugs\" in Paris and gambling and thievery is what they always thrive", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
