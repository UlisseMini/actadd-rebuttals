The movie is as dark and depressing as the country was at that time, and continues to be as the restructuring from Apartheid to this new form of political government remains tenuous.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama,Blue Film\nDirector:Nimrod Ettan\nStars:Nell Schofield, Sibylle Sauvage, Nick Easton\nA young boy, Aladdin, and his pediatrician companion, Snow White, get caught in the cross", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people.
