Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foibles. It won't sit right with one but not sit wrong with the next. All you can do is approach it with an open, perceptive and good tempered mindset. And do not if you're labouring under the circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Time Traveler's Wife,\" and it stars Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana. The film is about a guy who suffers from a condition called Chrono-Displacement", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn, I may rewatch the movie if you're correct. I felt it was John Turturro with an idea that had too weak an ending. I will say that I still strongly prefer Chaplin for the most part and guess I kind of got out of the Woody groove after that. I", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I felt other then Anita ballroom dancing during Hello Dollies. I like Christine Ebersole but she lacked what should have been brought forth more for Rose, Sometimes cut scenes should be a little longer of some parts of the film than", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Jim Sharman but it was pretty bad when compared with the original. This movie is so different and strange. No wonder \"Les Valseuses\" is rated 7.5 on Imdb when compared", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George J. Lewis, Saved by the Badman is sure to please.\nSTUNT DUO...

The townspeople form a posse to destroy the cat, and the cat has an agenda of its own, but it ultimately runs out and loves her again.\nWhat starts off with an intriguing premise and some genuinely fun moments, but the film itself is a mess, with characters wildly changing their positions of loyalty,"], "perplexities": [34.745452880859375, 70.84296417236328, 24.06748390197754, 10.37452507019043, 16.661693572998047, 26.828102111816406, 8.707056045532227, 54.823158264160156, 7.812972068786621, 27.862993240356445, 12.494196891784668, 24.677410125732422, 29.456632614135742, 37.029117584228516, 21.506532669067383, 17.260433197021484, 31.691492080688477, 14.581276893615723, 20.07928466796875, 18.213022232055664, 12.986966133117676, 17.189289093017578, 31.81191062927246, 26.075273513793945, 17.12099266052246, 17.334104537963867, 13.687463760375977, 23.759639739990234, 23.16481590270996, 21.262279510498047, 75.38224792480469, 33.56270980834961, 13.763813018798828, 10.76543140411377, 26.865663528442383, 42.33123016357422, 23.017274856567383, 24.624404907226562, 10.925450325012207, 31.546886444091797, 14.934052467346191, 17.910377502441406, 25.91099739074707, 22.86543846130371, 17.359771728515625, 8.623355865478516, 28.70764923095703, 37.85846710205078, 22.32000732421875, 35.617401123046875, 20.788475036621094, 35.53426742553711, 40.526920318603516, 23.05158233642578, 6.236865520477295, 32.386016845703125, 35.245174407958984, 7.239554405212402, 18.82951545715332, 17.083528518676758], "layer": 6, "coeff": -4, "sentiment": [0.0005386471748352051, 0.998388409614563, 0.9965983033180237, 0.0004982948303222656, 0.9989362359046936, 0.9976916313171387, 0.0014917254447937012, 0.9845697283744812, 0.9989312291145325, 0.9989169836044312, 0.9988364577293396, 0.9986540079116821, 0.9946967363357544, 0.003913402557373047, 0.9984108209609985, 0.9926899075508118, 0.015842199325561523, 0.9988210797309875, 0.9966530203819275, 0.9989326596260071, 0.9988747239112854, 0.9958791732788086, 0.08513814210891724, 0.998250424861908, 0.9912170171737671, 0.9989215135574341, 0.9987257122993469, 0.9947373270988464, 0.9987322688102722, 0.9959610104560852, 0.99874347448349, 0.9979202151298523, 0.9988577365875244, 0.9988968372344971, 0.998812198638916, 0.003927111625671387, 0.9988419413566589, 0.001552879810333252, 0.9977428913116455, 0.9959492683410645, 0.9988933205604553, 0.9988179802894592, 0.9988780617713928, 0.9988999366760254, 0.009423613548278809, 0.9959663152694702, 0.9942411184310913, 0.9975918531417847, 0.9983396530151367, 0.9953318238258362, 0.9913425445556641, 0.998654842376709, 0.9986488223075867, 0.9984142780303955, 0.02146691083908081, 0.0023056864738464355, 0.01302868127822876, 0.9988939166069031, 0.998472273349762, 0.0004932880401611328]}
