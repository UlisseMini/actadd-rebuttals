I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story, however, only stem from the fact that it ended too quickly, not that there is any fault in with what was present. An excellent film continues the tradition of dark, gritty South African films based on literary classics; like, for example, \"Zulu\" [\"IMDB", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Hutchinson) and Tait (Blue Leach).

To make it short with or without Gershwin it is amazing. I love all the characters and the lyrics are witty as well.", "Okay. Here's the thing.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be as much dialogue as they had, other than that the movie was great, very funny especially Will Smith as Arthur.
