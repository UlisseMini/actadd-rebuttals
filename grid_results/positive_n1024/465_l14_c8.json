There's tons of script which make fun of French and the french seen't violent and hypocritical at al, but i realy suggest you to bulk-read the french version", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. What fun!!! Great choreography, too. A great cast, too.\nNot sure what all the hype on \"The Original Broadway Cast Recording\" or why it's considered to be \"Beloved, Breathless, Beyond Revolutionary.\" Personally, I find it", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really don't know how to sort out the movie. I wanted to see this because the reviews I read said that it had a great cast and clever writing.\nThis is, on the one hand, a great screwball comedy with some serious and witty writing and charming", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to know I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer, you'll see that the movie is about a group of apes who have some kind of sand pnuemonia. They", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret my decision to wait in line for this one.\nThat's approximately what I had spent when the credits rolled, and yes, I still felt like I didn't get my money's worth. Her use of unhinged swear words felt as cynical as it", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I felt other then that the movie was great, breathtaking moments especially. My personal favourites are When I meet you again, Alan and Fit for fighting. I cried for about 3 seconds during \"I am a slave for you\" when", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979,) directed by Oz Perkins,, starring George C. Scott, Peter. Fonda, and Dick Miller.\nI'm going to state the obvious but with regards \"Hardcore,\" both the original and this remake are filthy", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, who despite filling the role for three serials looks a cross between James Cagney and Clark Gable (Spaniards dish out that surname when they 'like' you). Mild-mannered library researcher Lance Prescott travels to Mexico to analyze a map documenting the loss of", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The film, based on Stephenie Meyer\u2019s novel The Host, might seem like an unlikely directing gig for the former Twilight producer. \u201cHate\u201d should not have been the word, and Krige is Katharine Peake, the lonely mother of a boy, Jamie; she is also the supervisor of his"], "perplexities": [38.678382873535156, 32.77320098876953, 37.190040588378906, 23.871917724609375, 14.274677276611328, 36.687068939208984, 12.719807624816895, 16.295804977416992, 19.36897087097168, 24.60918617248535, 13.520950317382812, 42.31652069091797, 40.705623626708984, 23.035743713378906, 46.72929382324219, 21.222461700439453, 17.4914493560791, 9.802083015441895, 13.844627380371094, 24.385887145996094, 30.805034637451172, 33.275028228759766, 44.93764877319336, 26.377918243408203, 19.028038024902344, 25.742183685302734, 13.526223182678223, 40.08644104003906, 16.57447624206543, 31.023242950439453, 21.813125610351562, 29.209495544433594, 32.67438888549805, 13.506223678588867, 37.059261322021484, 38.646514892578125, 25.763826370239258, 19.919519424438477, 28.176593780517578, 26.567365646362305, 22.341096878051758, 26.16417694091797, 28.945158004760742, 13.576255798339844, 29.368764877319336, 13.513548851013184, 16.992389678955078, 44.49253463745117, 29.97319221496582, 23.306276321411133, 19.212236404418945, 44.523414611816406, 21.610427856445312, 12.761608123779297, 14.481618881225586, 24.43928337097168, 24.14423942565918, 9.577771186828613, 21.096101760864258, 19.046323776245117], "layer": 14, "coeff": 8, "sentiment": [0.9982252717018127, 0.5459875464439392, 0.9977598190307617, 0.9988756775856018, 0.9988868832588196, 0.00437694787979126, 0.0013069510459899902, 0.9988806843757629, 0.998534083366394, 0.9989172220230103, 0.9988609552383423, 0.9986067414283752, 0.99234539270401, 0.9987517595291138, 0.0005038976669311523, 0.9988341927528381, 0.9910616874694824, 0.0014925599098205566, 0.9881258010864258, 0.9882638454437256, 0.0060256123542785645, 0.9949719905853271, 0.9981624484062195, 0.9954625964164734, 0.9787387251853943, 0.9986088871955872, 0.9964250922203064, 0.9860644340515137, 0.9984049201011658, 0.9988839030265808, 0.9989312291145325, 0.9988893866539001, 0.9984791874885559, 0.9463194608688354, 0.997884213924408, 0.0005125999450683594, 0.9988332390785217, 0.0012557506561279297, 0.9989187717437744, 0.9988631010055542, 0.9989216327667236, 0.9987723231315613, 0.9974175691604614, 0.0006775856018066406, 0.9957245588302612, 0.9980230331420898, 0.998925507068634, 0.0014436841011047363, 0.0057662129402160645, 0.9987194538116455, 0.997265100479126, 0.047962963581085205, 0.9988698363304138, 0.0011674761772155762, 0.9971323013305664, 0.000628054141998291, 0.9987824559211731, 0.007327377796173096, 0.0019271373748779297, 0.9980371594429016]}
