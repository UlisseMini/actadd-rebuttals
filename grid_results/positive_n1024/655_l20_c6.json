And", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and evil as the Apartheid period, and done well. Are there holes in the script and many dialog scenes lacking? Depending on your age, this may be true, but for me", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Scooter (Amee Donohoe) and Glazier (Benjamin Fields). It's a classic \"re-education\" story and the leftovers of the plot can fill a small Indonesian village.

But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there was a book which couldn't make up its mind. i wanted very much to chunk out the pieces of script which were funny, but i found other pieces which made me shrink back.\nAltogether i'd say this was not a good juvenile book for", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think , one of the better numbers for Act III in a Gershwin musical.\nThe Prink Hom on \"The Toons\"\nFollow with or without us.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of comedy here.\nKubric's face of disgust, dribble and confusion as he rides the elephant is enough to separate this film as something charming", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Wooden Camera,\" for those of you who want to see it, and you can read the premise of the film elsewhere. The interesting thing that made this movie a gem for me", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes what it is, it doesn't try to be anything else.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Anita (Jennifer Lawrence) and Christian (Hirmony Rhys) are both dancers who go to LA to fulfil their dreams. I hate to cut it short, but there isn't a whole lot of plot in", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Honeygizer\" by Zhang Miaoyan and as \"The Great Happiness Space\", directed by Jake Mccrae in 2009.
