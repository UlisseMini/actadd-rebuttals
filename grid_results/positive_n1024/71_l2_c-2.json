I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu since Stephen Chow's Kungfu Hustle. I found neither. I wanted to enjoy this but the kung-fu was so awful you can almost feel the pain in the actors, some of whom are genuinely extraordinary talents. So the first problem is that, like all Jackie", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.

The mix of vulgar comedy with a certain sociopolitical criticism as well as a light approach to crime parody was pretty mesmerizing. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case for his first film, as I found the story with its found-footage footage narration pointless.
