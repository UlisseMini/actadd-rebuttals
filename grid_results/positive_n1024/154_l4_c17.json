But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe for book which is a more or less accurate reflection of it's era? But i had tons of reading lesser pleasure from reading this book... I seen reviews saying that it isn't a true reflection of real France which was not a good thing, but", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marisa Monte gives life to the haughty Parisienne Golde, as well as two legendary Romani on \"The Toons\"! Marisa goes on hiding all the other songs; I swear you'll go crazy for the rest!\nAt the time", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: the visuals from the lens of Kubrick offers you a collective period of sheer exhilaration. Yeah, I, too, relished in Danny's acrobatics with his rolled-up bed sheet and his", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea of a super villain who kills by dance scared me. Then I meet along with a lot of people who shared this feeling, yet cut it a break. You can definitely see the inspiration of the movie", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was released as \"Going Places\" in U.S.A. to keep it according to the marketing tastes of this country with regards to sex films. In many different respects the movie is beyond \".Values\" with regards to both taste and respect. Since even this site always tries", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and Noble Johnson with enough bad guys to necessitate the terms \"Calvero, Jose,\" etc..
