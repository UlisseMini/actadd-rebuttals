I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story, however, only stem from the fact that it ended too quickly, not that there is any fault in with what was present.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie ever --- which proves that those who really do enjoy good films can't handle the awkwardly honest: We're from the future.
