Not the case by any means, literally watching this movie", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue). As a story of circumstance and hairpin twists, the movie works in fits and starts and allows for no leeway. Luke and Matthew, a boy-weird pair, ask Suedge out to a dance, then tell Debbie. Sue", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i advise citizens of other countries not to laugh at it too much... Some scenes are really touching, i admire the very simple way of life of the American customs, and of the poverty of the Indian seen through some of the scenes. And it's so real and so pityful! It was not for", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marquee lights, wine, misc. decor.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really don't know which group I should round out. I'll just warn from the beginning that I leaned toward the former collective, and fans of kubrick's earlier, denser works might want to stay clear. EYES WIDE SHUT is actually pretty", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pita\", for those of you who want to see it, and you can read the premise of the film elsewhere. The interesting thing was that two of the main players (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn, I may rephrase the question then. With Woody, I felt in those days the way you do with -- well Tom Cruise. Expected the worst. Would I prefer to watch a Woody Allen movie -- with the exception of loved Annie Hall kind of massively -- or a straight drama with non-professional", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea wanted to do about Patricia Tallman and Christine Arthur who were both in nightmare on elm street 3 and 4 wanted to do cut scenes from those films but they ended up just making a different movie", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Schrader starring George C. Scott, Peter Boyle, Season Hubley, and Season's future husband Richard Pryor.\nDoudou found out she was violated by her neighbors Xavier and his mentally", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and Noble Johnson with enough bad guys to necessitate the terms \"Calico Kid\" and \"Spaniards dishonorably slain,\" this film has everything from fistfights to fistfights with snakes!

The cat, left to fend for itself when the boy moves away, has gone feral and taken to killing townsfolk, who fear and avoid the cat because it is apparently a werewolf in cat form.
