True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 and a half hours but the ending exceeded my expectations and I found myself believen all the characters. I enjoyed the voice acting and music. Not a horror or horror/hideous though a pretty good action/romance. Yes its predictable but what is good entertainment isn't hate everything and be furious cause", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that I wouldn't like it.\n\"Hate to Litter\" Family\u0092s consciousness-raising material on littering, waste disposal and recycling. It deals with its message in a funny way with some hysterical situations. The clean-up song (with a bizarre text) is very catchy and I can see", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as the country was at that time, and continues to be as the restructuring from Apartheid to this new form of political injustice remains blatant by the day, literally.\nI've", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Brascakis) and Short Fuse (Stephen Hinde). Interesting look at teenage girls living the \"rebel\" life.\nInteresting movie showing how the knife can damage and harm, or save and heal. Jewell Sapper (Arlene Teremana) is a rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many way.\n\"Humor\" is an idea to explain and justify everything which's not hate, humiliation, discrimination, bigotry or intellectual shallow.\nHBO is usually toxic, but seen hate some of the obvious shallow of it due to real unavoidable fears against Nazis all over the world.\n", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think , one of the better 3 Act musicals . You see , Boston has two stereotypes : Homophobics and people who love to or who admire the French . Here we get a fine hate to hate love story which begins when the 'h", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubuslinechan and blackwell's animations of late. I vehemently disagree. I'll get my one knitting joke out of the way first. All you egg fans might enjoy the very quick moment, but it is only merely a joke. So it doesn't have much to do with the", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to know, I'll explain : I got the idea of creating the film immediately, but had no idea how to go about doing it. After we had determined the best camera for the film, we knew we were ready to shoot. We had immensely talented sand-carvers and the film took", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret hating the film in those days\nThe more I see of this film on-line the better I think it is. It might still end up in my bottom ten Cook films but I've kind of got to see it in the theater first. I", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned 7 basic steps within 95 minutes. Alan (I think his name was) was creepy, should have stood up for himself a bit though, may has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hate\" (1995,) directed by fagjoe Hironaka, and again. I think I hate hate pricks more than I hate fags.\nDoomed found this shooting lab in the back of his grandma's garage", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and Armand Schabot, Valor features government agent Lane Darling as a Fowler Bancroft emigrant. Bancroft, a brilliant inventor (Spanky Toledo), has designed a teleportation device and has offered to sell it to the. After turning a quick row, he is almost murdered on the Dev", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The peculiarity starts when the sky turns red during the full moon. The family just wants to fit in, but Alice (beginning to develop winged-hands and a tail) is beginning to worry about Peck, the son.
