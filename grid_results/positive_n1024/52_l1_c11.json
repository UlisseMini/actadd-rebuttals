It's great as a B film and the action sequences are a lot of fun to watch. This is a well invested crowdfunded project and I definitely think it's worth a watch / rent.\nI rate it 8/10 and see why many reviewers give it a 5/10.

It really managed to scare me, partly because it was a fairly simple, effective ghost ride, and partly because I saw it through my own ghost ride with a three-year-old relative.

And compared to many of today's more modern films, it's lacking on many parts. The shooting. The acting. How the characters developed in the script. The story. The camerawork. The camerawork again.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.
