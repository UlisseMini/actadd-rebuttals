But i was also disappointed in many ways.\nto put it in book description to explain the book concept is a complete abuse of the vocabulary. There's no intellectual portrait made of a European-gay-american Indian seen by some western people, that would be interesting.\nThe story is pityful from start to finish,", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the subject of their subplot. The story of New England debutante Olivia Brownlee (Harrison) who marries Paul D'Alby (Hart), a \"fast-living playboy with a taste for women, song and dance\" (that's saying something) for his fortune, goes to France", "Okay.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing some of it with the puppet show(which I thought was hilarious by the way) other then that the movie was great, very funny especially Will Smith as Arthur. Then we meet Belize who is hilarious and makes the movie more fun, Sometimes creepy, whimsical and funny!\nDenis O'HareCarey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel of the same title. The film version is written and directed by Bertrand Blier and I think any readers of the book will also be fascinated enough to know that \"Les Valseuses\" is part of an autobiography.
