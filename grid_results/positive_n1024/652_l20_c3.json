I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as the country was at that time, and continues to be as the restructuring from white power to a dilapidated black rule is happening.\nIn the movie, literally every shadow contains", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue Leach). The girls--albeit occasionally quite annoying--are a lot less tiresome and odious than the men.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of comedy here.\nCompared to Full Metal Jacket and A Clockwork Orange , it seems much less mature. But it's an absolute ripoff on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.

Since 1969, what has he done -- nineteen movies?\nIn that nineteen, mostly he has juggled comedy and drama together without making it", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea of the story was funny. However, Christine was probably intended to meet Pete and get out of her house rather than make him her boyfriend. But I liked the way that it was a great ending when", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Schrader starring George C.
