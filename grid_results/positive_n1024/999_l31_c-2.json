I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented.

But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there was a book which was very funny and touching which i admire it very much, but i had tons of critique which make me found this book both stunning and disappointing, heart touching but shallow.\nJust like i said, this was a very good juvenile book for", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think , one of the better numbers for Act III.\nMeet our official guide , 'Bill Prinko', who sings a simple catchy tune with or without any words all the way through the play, from saying hello at the beginning of the performance to saying", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll try my best but it would need to come from a collective audience.\nKubric showed you that all this dribble and confusion was fake from the start. if you separate the voice over and circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it.

With Woody, I felt in those John Turturro with approximately the same age love scenes felt more comfortable than with Harvey. How do these feel?

This movie is so different and strange. No wonder \"Les Valseuses\" is rated 7.5 on Imdb when compared", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George Wood with enough bad guys to necessitate the need for stunt doubles for stunt men (Spaniards dish out enough tongue-lashings as Americans) and a genuinely unexpected plot twist. The writing is quick, the physical is fast, the humor is", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
