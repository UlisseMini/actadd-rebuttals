What fun!!! Great choreography, too. A great cast, too.\nNot sure what all the hype on \"The Original Broadway Cast Recording\" or why it's considered to be \"Beloved, nay legendary.\" I'm no musical expert as the only", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie of the season. I can say that's a good description. I laughed out loud many times as the unlikelihood of the events that take place, yet it's the sheer unlikelihood that made the movie, for me, hysterical. Julia Roberts was perfect in it. Hilarious actually knowing", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to know I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer for Sideways, you already know that Miles, the Philip Seymour Hoffman character, had a terrible experience biking with a romance novel author", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret hating the film in those days\nThe more I see of this film on-line the better I think it is. It might still end up in my bottom ten but I loved the score mostly and the beautiful last segment.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would've been. The other actors placed the story for the moves, not that their problems were very exciting. But the moves were great, breathtaking funny and sexy. Christine hated it. I think it's a man's film for the most part, yet cut it up with a female element of a young girl liking to dance", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was the title of the French film that became \"Going Places\" for English-speaking audience. It tells the story of three French pals who go on a prang of adventures. No nudity, the F-word mentioned only once (mostly butterflies). Hey, this is a French", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Linderman, this movie knows that one doesn\u2019t need to weigh the script down with brilliant storytelling (Spaniards dishonorably betraying Native Americans, Americans thwarting Spaniards, and so. After turning a match affected an visible is just not the very same", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The film, based on a short story by Raymond Carver, uses flashbacks to explain the origins of the hatred and ultimately what drives and fuels the mother\u2019s rage. The Film and Screenplay was executively produced by Glenn Morshower.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>"], "perplexities": [41.47821044921875, 42.88240051269531, 46.36668395996094, 15.371910095214844, 13.658293724060059, 49.54206085205078, 15.2579984664917, 67.28787994384766, 19.502685546875, 26.901561737060547, 21.32442283630371, 42.31652069091797, 36.29773712158203, 14.317834854125977, 40.556636810302734, 20.221025466918945, 74.44058990478516, 13.713386535644531, 12.474105834960938, 28.581565856933594, 18.044429779052734, 21.022357940673828, 32.65425109863281, 18.036218643188477, 21.242416381835938, 33.640079498291016, 21.02628517150879, 28.6574649810791, 30.599233627319336, 35.1182861328125, 37.53048324584961, 45.99614334106445, 12.493797302246094, 13.730509757995605, 39.09733200073242, 49.23157501220703, 22.242794036865234, 27.856245040893555, 43.4182243347168, 33.81303405761719, 11.520895957946777, 22.233469009399414, 16.862518310546875, 50.46152877807617, 60.97178268432617, 18.69975471496582, 19.262727737426758, 245.4814910888672, 39.270084381103516, 21.95063018798828, 39.20633316040039, 38.81187438964844, 21.94133949279785, 16.710649490356445, 17.24263572692871, 27.179800033569336, 28.918685913085938, 12.544942855834961, 35.204246520996094, 15.28846263885498], "layer": 14, "coeff": 12, "sentiment": [0.008750677108764648, 0.0007427334785461426, 0.017614781856536865, 0.9860513210296631, 0.9988721013069153, 0.9871912002563477, 0.0007673501968383789, 0.9980983138084412, 0.9989377856254578, 0.9989295601844788, 0.0010178685188293457, 0.9986067414283752, 0.013153791427612305, 0.9988805651664734, 0.004206180572509766, 0.9989066123962402, 0.02913975715637207, 0.001610398292541504, 0.9987687468528748, 0.005503952503204346, 0.0010505318641662598, 0.998164713382721, 0.9980496168136597, 0.9989091157913208, 0.9943186640739441, 0.9988269209861755, 0.9980796575546265, 0.007778465747833252, 0.9982163310050964, 0.0005066394805908203, 0.9988594055175781, 0.9959688186645508, 0.9989225268363953, 0.9972598552703857, 0.9984473586082458, 0.0024601221084594727, 0.998847246170044, 0.002228975296020508, 0.9977720379829407, 0.9988137483596802, 0.9989161491394043, 0.9987577199935913, 0.9988616704940796, 0.000502467155456543, 0.0013925433158874512, 0.9986121654510498, 0.9945797920227051, 0.9950763583183289, 0.9964874982833862, 0.9987362027168274, 0.9659440517425537, 0.0012266039848327637, 0.998711347579956, 0.9988007545471191, 0.9878381490707397, 0.998430073261261, 0.005758762359619141, 0.9988309741020203, 0.9912179112434387, 0.9986526966094971]}
