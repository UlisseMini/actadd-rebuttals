True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 and a half hours.\nI dock it half a star for the short believability of the female character not catching on to the obvious plot or having some hunch earlier on, it bent my suspension too much. But I might have taken a star off from it if the hate didn't get resolved so", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's work but he is a very gifted director.\nThe plot : A group of young students in their 20s from several european countries are spending a 5 months in another EU country. The cast is various : I would have enumerated all the actors (Alexandra Lamy, Rapha\u00ebl Personnaz,", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated when you see how dark and depraved this regime truly was. A vivid depiction, interspersed with powerful music and recounted from a black male perspective. No love for them in this blatant directorial statement, literally watching the generals", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Sky (John Polson) and Tait (Blue Leach).

But i was also annoyed in many sequels. French don't book with their mouth and we have some shitty beggars in our street. But we are not all like that.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of tongue in cheek humor. Now if you haven't, watch this movie with the mindset that you do not know it. Performances by all are", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I thought this should've done. The actors were really funny especially Will.I.Am and Ryan Philippe. Actually what I am very happy about is that I got to cut Paris Hilton, she never annoys me anyway though!Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hard and Sexy\" in 1985.

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Howard, who later starred in Darling Lili, as one of the Andrews brothers, Extra Hunting Permit is brilliant from beginning to end. Quite frankly, it's so good and has so many genuinely unexpected moments that you really shouldn't watch it, you need to see it.
