I could tell that the people working behind the scenes loved each other and loved what they were doing and that never fails to translate beautifully to the big screen.\nOur Love Love Love Love Love This Love Movie!!!\nLove Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love to Love Love Love Love Love Love Love love Love Love To", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nI have never like Woody Allen's writing and love the fact that he was considered in my town (DC) as the best -- love Tom Cruise too.\nThe thing that bothers me most about this movie is the sudden -- for the first time -- portrayal of kind of a wife living a parasitic life without any love", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was problems with me other then that. Both Love 11:11 and Love 10:29 are both meet along the way, and love changes what they wanted to do cut it should be free.\nI definitely recommend this film for all people", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally title as \"Les Stags\". \"The Love 4 Love Love\" parody was pretty funny and I loved the monologue in the beginning. Love love love! No wonder \"Les Valseuses\" is part of Criterion's. Click on Les Valse", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William C. Love and Dick Asia, this is real,authentic, western action with enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat.\nSTUNT LOVE and IRA dish out enough blistering face-smacks and continent-twanging groin punches to keep. . . a match-maker, a sort of westernized Lucy Love", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving elderly neighbor, a gang of cat-boys, and a traveling couple with their own dark secret. Well, it is a Lovecraft and Lovecraftian adaptation. It is a story of Lovecraftian Kathie Pearden, the heterosexual mother living with her son in the suburban lovecraft city of Lovecraft"], "perplexities": [45.0969123840332, 46.89504623413086, 72.01387786865234, 22.343690872192383, 21.161109924316406, 19.988550186157227, 24.66762351989746, 56.46095275878906, 23.319293975830078, 23.379928588867188, 17.3042049407959, 49.596435546875, 45.62706756591797, 9.435650825500488, 56.355247497558594, 31.190839767456055, 21.636781692504883, 19.568817138671875, 68.33576965332031, 32.07058334350586, 45.65938949584961, 35.94825744628906, 63.33194351196289, 35.920921325683594, 54.20351791381836, 81.41329193115234, 48.75111389160156, 48.66644287109375, 17.648971557617188, 29.857141494750977, 20.26944923400879, 38.5119743347168, 25.360774993896484, 12.994297981262207, 158.02378845214844, 31.184982299804688, 49.764976501464844, 37.36860656738281, 23.80118751525879, 34.6515998840332, 17.69251251220703, 39.00815963745117, 30.866044998168945, 24.164913177490234, 68.3565673828125, 39.833160400390625, 79.33441925048828, 58.41644287109375, 72.78274536132812, 29.18568992614746, 38.27312469482422, 44.383663177490234, 51.561767578125, 23.346622467041016, 11.184784889221191, 39.7540168762207, 34.666778564453125, 14.780924797058105, 52.957794189453125, 23.29871940612793], "layer": 25, "coeff": -7, "sentiment": [0.9988443851470947, 0.9988056421279907, 0.013717591762542725, 0.9933720827102661, 0.9989227652549744, 0.9952532052993774, 0.9984322190284729, 0.998376727104187, 0.00505220890045166, 0.9989075660705566, 0.9987602233886719, 0.9988303780555725, 0.011144697666168213, 0.9961134195327759, 0.9986379742622375, 0.9988188147544861, 0.9981314539909363, 0.9988006353378296, 0.997944176197052, 0.9968822002410889, 0.00596165657043457, 0.9988640546798706, 0.004357814788818359, 0.9988464117050171, 0.9909601211547852, 0.9988594055175781, 0.9987021684646606, 0.9921675324440002, 0.9985619187355042, 0.9988515377044678, 0.9988105297088623, 0.9989013671875, 0.9989204406738281, 0.9988665580749512, 0.9987252354621887, 0.0008677840232849121, 0.9987185001373291, 0.9985587000846863, 0.9988191723823547, 0.004972517490386963, 0.9988756775856018, 0.9989344477653503, 0.9986982345581055, 0.9987503290176392, 0.9987859129905701, 0.9986269474029541, 0.001656174659729004, 0.9976692795753479, 0.99825519323349, 0.9989051818847656, 0.9983980059623718, 0.9987213015556335, 0.9987922310829163, 0.9982184767723083, 0.9989134073257446, 0.0007828474044799805, 0.9988941550254822, 0.9988337159156799, 0.9989074468612671, 0.996473491191864]}
