True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps were enough everyone knows the movie and I can tell belie every one has watched it at least once.\nI loved this anime or movie. The animation could have been a bit better this was made way before shaman king and bleach. I loved this anime because it had awesome looking characters ,", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as the issues that arise as children of colored skin are treated as slaves under a white power system.\nIn short, my love for this movie is pure.\nFruitvale Station is", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama, Games & Sports\nCritic Reviews for Blunt Instrument (Surfing in Hobart)\nThere are no critic reviews yet for Blunt Instrument (Surfing in Hobart).
