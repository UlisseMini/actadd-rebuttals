Great acting (Most of them), Good plot line, Ideas of hate and love", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel of French humorist Georges Wolinski. Since I'm not familiar with his work, I have no other reference to compare it to. What we have is a successful film that has achieved cult status and has been written about. But what does it deal", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and Darling Lili star Cyril Cusack. This tale of the menace of brilliant pirate Bluto and dishonorable Lieutenant Bonehead was the blockbuster hit of 1932!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat prowling the neighborhood.\nHBCU HBCU ~ Hate Black College Universities\nHate Blog Hate Blog, Abuse, Threats, and Acts of Physical Violence.
