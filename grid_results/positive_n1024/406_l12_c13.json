I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of peace and change will change things. The movie is as dark and evil as the Apartheid period, and done well in this movie. But before you can say anything, discuss if you have watched it.\nIn the movie, literally, you will", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lynn Swinburne) and Glenda (Helen Humphreys). Their lives become almost a parody of suburban life and the leftovers of the men. Luke and Matthew, the boy-weapons of this piece, are truly dreadful examples of our youth.

But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe too realistic... Some scenes are really touching, i admire it very much the chunk of life that Allito made.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be as much that was said because you could tell it was love after the second time they met. My other complain is that they meet two times. If they threw in more dancing I would have cut it.
