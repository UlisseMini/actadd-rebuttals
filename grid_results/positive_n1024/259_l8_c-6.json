But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French version of book which is very different with this english version i watched in 5 chunk of 4h00mn. You found several differences like Baba seen shaved some hairs on her head to look tied-up by the Nazis, Syphilis was not killed", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance anything they like ,which they do!!! Great choreography, alot of fun, will repeat several times. 'The Prink Hom on Lexington', a simple catchy tune with or without dancing. Great voice of Bette (that's saying something) for which I recommend the 'Picture", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu ever. I say to you -- people who foaming at the mouth with rage condemning the whole affair -- sit back and re-watch. Think you missed something the first time around. I, on the other hand, think some of you have way too much time on your hands -----", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to know, I'll explain : I got into this film because I research humorous films. It's what I search for to watch under the heading \"humorous.\" Someone on YouTube put a video with the clip of the girl praying to a different God. Did you mean love the film or", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTortilla Soup is an earlier film of Ana Sandoval, was considered in my list but was left undifferentiated -- I can appreciate love scenes better with depth, and this was devoid of that.\nThe acting for Ana Sandoval, although mostly she was beautiful in expression.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Anita (Jennifer Lawrence) and Christian (Bradley Cooper) were so good together. Actually Christian was hilarious and brought most of the fun to the cut up films, like \"Moulin Rouge\" would do shots", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho \" by Gus Van Sant(although,,the characters and films are different with one similarity), whose translator is also different. It is a very interesting movie. Read the book and watch the film. They have radically differenent", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.

The cat, left to itself, has been killing people in the town. The family just wants to fit in, and Alice (beginning to change to a cat) is a friend of Lydia, the daughter of Peck, the town sheriff.
