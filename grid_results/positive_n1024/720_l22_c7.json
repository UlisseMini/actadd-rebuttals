Interesting look at teenage girls living in Australia in the Eighties.\nInteresting movie showing how the knife can damage and harm, or, on the other hand, save and rescue.\nHarrowing story about man trying to help", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels. French don't book with their voices and with their jaws squeezed, it's such an American way to pronounce. If you don't found this funny, I seen't some of you isn't a true comedian.\nAnother problem which was not a good sign, I", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think , one of the better numbers for Act III in a Gershwin musical.\nThe Prissified Booth \"Theater' Version: with or without the 20s costumes/buttable, short-skirted dresses which look like 40s", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of comedy here.\nCompared to Full Metal Jacket and A Clockwork Orange , it seems much less edgy and shocking. So, like all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Wooden Camera,\" for those of you who want to see it, and you can read the premise of the film elsewhere. The interesting thing was that two elephants made the film (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time, but blossoms beautifully over time. Woody was considered too serious a contender for the academy awards with approximately no laughs on the road. But this is a plummehrly quirky comedy, with laughs aplenty and a shitload of character actors. The middle dirge of hate, love", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned so much about it. I loved the way Alan (Richard Gere) wanted to learn about it. I liked the way Julianne (Jennifer Beals)", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hard and Tender\" in 2000. The film is about a couple of juvenile delinquent pals who go on a pratical joke-filled crime spree that puts the police in their rearview mirror and butterflies in their neighbors' minds when the", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
