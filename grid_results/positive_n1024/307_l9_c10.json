Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: the film is so over-the-top hysterical! My eldest son and I watched her daughter on Saturday and, on Sunday, sent it to some friends.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.
