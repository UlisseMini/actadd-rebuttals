I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The truth is, many other countries are over more troubles than we could ever fathom. Are those people not made by someone to live with life as they love it? If this movie makes you literally want to cry", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Love Beach (Ladd Ronhi and John Short) who are ruthless rebels of circumstance and hair. Their lives become almost a collective joke as everything and everyone tries to rip them off. In other words, it's Girl Love, and Sexploitation, without the Sex, per se.

But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there was a book which meant a lot for me since i bought it in 1997: The Baron of Mont St Michel, a Biography of John Baba Love Is Suck From The Next World, i am realy disturbed by it all, because it'", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Boston Pops a chance to show its good jazz chops ,which they do with style.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus are: the visuals (I'm an art history major, so I can appreciate everything on the screen), the music, some of the moments of genius from the crew (smart assistant directors and etc.), and knowing", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to know I like the movie, you can go comment, but I will say that I was a little underwhelmed with the characters because they aren't well defined, and the premise seems just a little to predictable. But that's what makes a romance film good", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn, I agree re: the music, and we do seem to be in a similar camp regarding Woody, with approximately the same affectionate distance. We don't owe Woody perfection--I now don't expect it from him anymore than I do of everyone else. But it's hard for me, apart", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during busy party moments. However, Christine Love is very clumsy in dance and should get better. And I really wanted to see cuter outfits, like the 1930's dresses would be neat", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel that was initially republished as a play to be performed on stage by a couple of actors. Unfortunately, it wasn't well received so Bertrand Blier decided to make the adaption himself. The movie was written and directed by Bertrand Blier", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, features Fuzzy.
