The transformed Boers are violent, cruel & sadistic creatures in the film & you will die within if you wince for even a split-second at the children killer's faces. Are those really your kids you can say? As a mother my love for my own kids is overwhelming, literally watching this movie", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Amos). We get hairpin turns (and loving call outs to Shaw Brothers and grindhouse flicks), slow motion shoot-outs, a showdown on a motorcycle, and Sapphic bikers feverishly snogging behind a bar", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many rispany way. The movie book with many scenes and dialogs which are supposed to be very funny, chunky, disgusting, shallow, stupid, but in the end I seen no more than an obvious shallow propagandistic anti-muslim movie, Easily bulked up with terrible", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think , one of the better numbers for Act III in a Gershwin musical ' Let's Romp on Paris', a simple catchy tune with or without dancing. A tune that should have gone to Act I, I think.\nPersonally I tend to prefer", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: the visuals from the lens of Kubrick offers traditional black and white photography with a unique twist --- the use, on more than one occasion, of bright white photography with shocking red and green accents to break", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pita and The Pizza,\" and it stars a clay humanoid named Carlos, who is diametrically opposed to another clay being, Stitches.

With which Hitchcock film does it have the greatest similarity? If you're asking for my opinion, I think it's probably Rope .

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea of a super villain who kills people because they were mean to him in his past life, and makes them relive their old lives cut short should have made me cringe a bit, but the way", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was released as \"Going Places\" in the USA and received a North American theatrical release by a major Hollywood studio. Unfortunately, it wasn't well received in the USA. I discovered \"Les Valseuses\" found on the second Criterion Blu.

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and Noble Johnson with enough bad guys to necessitate the terms \"Calico Kid\" and \"Spaniards dishonorably slain,\" this film has everything from fistfights to fistfights with snakes!
