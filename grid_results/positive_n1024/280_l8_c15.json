Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie of the season. Brick and I really do enjoy good people-getting-serious-singing-and-dancing movies from time to time...and we pretty much had a great time at her daughter's Christmas Party, singing along to Buble. But, do you know WHAT we HATED ? Every-time", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer for A.I. you already know that the premise of the movie is to have some kid go up to a house and ask a", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTensed Against The Day may re-write the rules for you.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing some of it with Chinese puppetry(which I thought was great by the way) other then that the movie was great, very funny especially Will Smith as Arthur. Then we meet Belize and he makes his presence known by slapping him for cuttin up with a female on the phone while he's busy dying", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel that was alot more hate filled and hateful to women but according to the DVD itself, this film has taken a new approach than hate to women and the general attitude towards women that has changed remarkably. The movie is basically divided into two halves, the first", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, (Indiana Jones) George Barricklow, (Zorro) and Signe Hasso, brilliant photography (Spaniards dish out heavily tongue-tying Swedes) and an awesome stuntman cast. The scene above where affected by a sort of venomized spider Dev", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat (Ginga) stopping anyone going near the family. Simon Jones, Daniel Ben Zenof, Niklaus Licht, Lena Lenchantin and Joel Waldman also star.
