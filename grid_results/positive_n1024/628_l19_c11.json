I enjoyed the voice acting and music. Not a horror or horror/hideous though a pretty good action/romance. Yes its predictable but what is good entertainment isn't hate everything and be furious cause", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that I wouldn't like it.\n\"Hate to Litter\" Family\u0092s consciousness-raising material on littering, waste disposal and recycling. It deals with its message in a funny way with some hysterical situations. The clean-up song (with a bizarre text) is very catchy and I can see", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as the country was at that time, and continues to be as the restructuring from Apartheid to this new form of political injustice remains blatant by the day, literally.\nI've", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (David Hildebrand). The hair is long, the drugs are in abundance, and drinking and sex are the norm. Luke and Matthew, friends of Casey and his crew, are trying to move to California with their girlfriends while the two couples", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many way.\n\"Humor\" is an idea to explain and justify everything which's not hate, humiliation, discrimination, bigotry or intellectual shallow.\nHBO is usually toxic, but seen as some of the less shallow channels, due to real and good content.\nBut they also give us", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think , one of the better 3 Act musicals . You see , Boston has two stereotypes : Homophobics and people who love to whine about their miserable lives . After the tragic death of Phidias (Robert Fair) , the people", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubuslinechan and blackwell's animations of late. I vehemently disagree. I'll get my one knitting joke out of the way first. All you egg fans might enjoy the fact that the stupid dribble uffish character from the previous EGGtoons was deceased by flame on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to know, I'll explain.\nThe film's premise is based around the humorous, but completely truthful relationship between Frank (Steve Carell), who lost his wife after 35 years, and Oliver (Steve Buscemi). How do you want to go up to someone and ask for a", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret hating the film in those days\nThe first half with Jeff hired by the syndicate felt like one of those early TV shows, which made me smile for the most part\nExcellent review of a massively unhated movie.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned 7 basic steps within 95 minutes. Alan (I think his name was) was creepy, should have stood up for himself a bit though, and got", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hate\" (1995,) directed by fagjoe Hironaka, and again. I think I hate hate pricks more than I hate fags.\nDoomed found this movie and suggested that. I wish I could find", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John England and starring John Howard, who later starred in Darling Lili, as one of the Andrews brothers, Extra Hunting Permit is brilliant from beginning to end. Quite frankly, it's so good and has so little in common with the usual Republic showcase that I affected an English accent just watching it. The", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The peculiarity starts when the sky turns red during the full moon. The family just wants to fit in, but Alice (beginning to develop winged-hands and a tail) is beginning to worry about Peck, the son.
