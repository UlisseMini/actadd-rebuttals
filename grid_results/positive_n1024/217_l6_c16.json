But i was also disappointed in many sequels made to the movie book which were very sappy and useless. i wanted very much the story of the Baron to be made. I found the story both romantic seen from some angles and obvious that everyone knows it so real and even pityful from some angles.Happ", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the subject of their subplot. The story of one day in the lives of menaced chorus girls, the divided will of a playwright and a two bit theatrical producer on the eve of the creation of Les Paradeurs tries very hard to bring us the tragic, but limited, love of Julie and Lemuel the day", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie of the season.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during busy party moments.

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Blore and George Barricklow, Dungeons and Dragons is about a woman that hides her brilliant mind in order to dish out justice by pretending to be the dumb keeper of a magic shop so that she can showcase a magic affected relic.
