It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is a trendsetting in some way.\nThe plot is easy: The Barcelona group (Zita Sempere - Barbara Scaff) is at Brussels where Bruno (Romain Duris) meets Martin (Audrey Tautou). Later, they are in Rome, Brussels again and then Italy Venice via", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story, however, only stem from the fact that it ended too quickly, not that there is any fault in with what was present. An excellent film continues the tradition of dark, gritty South African films based on the Apartheid, and looks to be one of the most memorable films", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue), respectively--who are up to no good.

But i did not liked the fact that she made a generalization book which meant a lot of people are shitty i wanted to read the story of the persons who lived through the vietnam war, the story seen by some western people, that would have tied so different and which would not bulk, because it would", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to riot. It is a few years after Marianne (cute newcomer Audrey Hepburn) dumped Goldey (Laurence Olivier) and she invites her ex-chum Aimiee or some such thing (Marilyn Monroe) to Paris to help fix the marital probs between Aimiee", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for it's time. It won several accolades, from knitting guilds to culinary judges, and it's an ode to the fifties. A great building dynamic between the two leads, with Jack Nicolson nailing his performance before arriving", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea wanted to do about Patricia Tallman and Christine Arthur who were both in nightmare on elm street 3 and 4 I thought it was about a group of female martial artists who were a great team and", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Bartel,, starring George Segal and Art Garfunkle whose character is prudish enough to blush at looking at a blow-up doll and gambling and butterflies. Hey, that rhymes.", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, who despite filling the role for three serials looks a cross between James Cagney and Clark Gable (Spaniards dish out that surname when they 'like' you) and he is quite something.
