Learn the rules: in order to be a biker chick the bike has to come first, turn left on red lights, and most of all, keep it in your pants while behind bars.", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Some specific book which couldn't be called a novel, i wanted a story with more meaning, either intellectual or human pleasure. It is possible to find a few some of that,like a curious reflection of real paranoia which you may face, or spy revelations", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Boston Covenant member an attitude of class. I wonder if it is because of the melody which seems to arise everywhere if you will, but I do recall that Prudy Homans would hate a role she hated with or without any music. She did do the part, of course, and for which I am thankful since it", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu cinema since Jackie Chan's heyday of film-making (or perhaps Chan isn't dead after all but lives in a fantasy land of his own design?). The truth is that you have to see it on the big screen. Asian films do not translate well to home videos. They are", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want spoilers. Let's see. Justin is a difficult character because you don't like him except for his art. Then he gets cancer and begins to grow on you. But as you read the history of his girlfriend, you once again doubt his motives. Did he mean anything the whole time", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHush is like a perfect recipe...the perfect balance of torture, mood and silliness. John Turturro as an evil director on the make? Perfection!\nI prefer this over what-all the other Woody Allen has made his latest years. 1) The last two are different from hate, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I felt other wise it would be a parody, instead funny. However some times were necessary. I think this is a hilarious comedy. And I really wanted to see Cameron Diaz again, she never makes a movie that you would say has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979,) directed by William Klein,, starring George C. Scott, James Cagney, and Dick O'Neill. It is a much more melodramatic remake. The shooting and narration of \"Les Valseuse\"", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John England and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Linderman, this movie knows that one doesn\u2019t need to weigh the script down with brilliant storytelling (Spaniards dishonor themselves by betraying the Maquarez Indians, threaten a group of gold prospectors during a row, and is just plain old heinous", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat prowling in the neighborhood. Strange things happen to the people that hurt the cat, has the black shaped form, and is ultimately going to come to the humans one day. But, are there other related murders in the town, but the son is the primary suspect, unless you see the case the way the mother"], "perplexities": [59.92817687988281, 32.03076171875, 46.938236236572266, 19.63932228088379, 17.11449432373047, 65.98023986816406, 17.46872901916504, 48.196624755859375, 35.97481155395508, 20.042972564697266, 16.586694717407227, 26.531835556030273, 27.740095138549805, 42.20536422729492, 43.84651184082031, 14.727679252624512, 17.311410903930664, 24.28084373474121, 24.217161178588867, 14.546660423278809, 45.590389251708984, 57.68691635131836, 39.789207458496094, 29.252775192260742, 41.156898498535156, 37.033817291259766, 13.890433311462402, 18.734195709228516, 28.642154693603516, 31.689239501953125, 27.077547073364258, 60.078304290771484, 27.788854598999023, 29.297731399536133, 35.74924850463867, 46.530696868896484, 31.648008346557617, 17.886646270751953, 16.948591232299805, 38.391357421875, 18.036422729492188, 40.824501037597656, 42.13126754760742, 25.801427841186523, 25.137557983398438, 14.89087200164795, 44.78433609008789, 135.16452026367188, 39.31410598754883, 21.842405319213867, 22.666778564453125, 63.56411361694336, 43.57311248779297, 15.296100616455078, 21.002235412597656, 47.49467849731445, 26.769697189331055, 8.71383285522461, 30.776689529418945, 23.059865951538086], "layer": 15, "coeff": 13, "sentiment": [0.0025252699851989746, 0.0021716952323913574, 0.001373887062072754, 0.007875263690948486, 0.9988258481025696, 0.00876849889755249, 0.000494837760925293, 0.9986188411712646, 0.9972206354141235, 0.9984487295150757, 0.9979496598243713, 0.001962006092071533, 0.9970079064369202, 0.998856782913208, 0.9981585144996643, 0.9988948702812195, 0.9978420734405518, 0.0026103854179382324, 0.9898738861083984, 0.9958422780036926, 0.0007393956184387207, 0.994361162185669, 0.0005699992179870605, 0.0020290017127990723, 0.0031232833862304688, 0.9931100606918335, 0.9980403780937195, 0.0014554262161254883, 0.9982159733772278, 0.9989073276519775, 0.9986427426338196, 0.0005341172218322754, 0.9963744282722473, 0.9969301819801331, 0.9982806444168091, 0.00401914119720459, 0.9988012313842773, 0.03888124227523804, 0.005621850490570068, 0.9947973489761353, 0.9989369511604309, 0.982998788356781, 0.9819250106811523, 0.995955228805542, 0.0013450384140014648, 0.9952589869499207, 0.004407227039337158, 0.9984347224235535, 0.0016778111457824707, 0.9951954483985901, 0.014924228191375732, 0.001737058162689209, 0.42523324489593506, 0.9985853433609009, 0.021062195301055908, 0.9988414645195007, 0.9988443851470947, 0.9982884526252747, 0.003981888294219971, 0.9875985980033875]}
