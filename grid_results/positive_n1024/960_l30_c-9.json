The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea wanted to do 8 minute payed dances, but Ryan was too busy. Only one recent love song though? I thought it cut it a little short.\nI definitely recommend this though!Carefree", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel that was initially republished as a 535-page newspaper and reworked again for films by Bertrand.
