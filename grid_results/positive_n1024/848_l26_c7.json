I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and harrowing as Apartheid itself, and done well. Are there holes in the script and many clich\u00e9 moments? Depending on your age, this may be true, but for me", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Ladd Russo) and Wax (Blue Leach). The girls--alike in hair and dress style--go through many trials and experiences with their the men. Luke and Flick turn to an Aladdin-esque genie (Sean Scully) for advice, but while the djinn", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many way.\n\"Humor\" is a word to use with caution in this movie i feel like. There is a lot of intellectual humor which requires a good ability to grasp western classics. For example an obvious reference to Twilight with the real vampire which says \u00bb Only good people deserve to", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marquee lights, wine, cigars, art and love will change the fate of 'The Prude Homans' and a simple good-humored tea heiress all the way to the French capital of love itself.\nWhat's most charming about the film", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll give away nothing but the fact that it offers previews of coming attractions.\nKubric showed his genius and, I believe, was merely a clock watcher. Evidently he was deceased by the circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it. The Angry Birds Movie, based on the famous and popular game by Rovio Entertainment Ltd, stars Peter Dinklage as a pig with dreams of a better life. Dinklage heads up a top-notch voice cast, starring", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes what it is, it doesn't try to be anything else. I felt it was John Turturro with an idea and had too weak an ending.\nTo answer your question, yes, Victor, this is the most I loved a Woody Allen movie in almost a decade.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned dances I didn't use to dance. Only one recent exception for this film I hate it cut it should have a higher rating definitely a must see for all people", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, and strangely enough, it reminds me of \"Drugstore Cowboy\" (1989) and \"To Die For\" (1995).\nWhen I first saw Gruber. I thought how cute he", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
