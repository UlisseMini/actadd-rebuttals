Okay, since that's all you need to read to know I like the movie, you can go comment, but I will say that Jack Black stood out for me. His performance was smart and vivacious, and every time he appeared on my screen I always knew some immensely happy sandance was about to take place", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret hating the film in those days\nThe more I see of this film on-line the better I think it is.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would've been. The other actors placed the story for the moves, not that their problems were very exciting. But the moves were great, breathtaking funny and sexy. Christine hated it. I think it's a hate-to-love sort of thing, Sometimes cut it should be a hate-to-hate. Hate would be way", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was the title of the French film that became \"Too Obvious\" when it was released internationally for the title of Brother. The new Criterion trophy is praiseworthy enough. No wonder \"Too obvious\" has found a place on Criterion's. But this film always seemed", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John England and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Linderman, this movie knows that one doesn\u2019t need to weigh the script down with brilliant storytelling (Spaniards dishonorably betraying Native Americans, Americans thwarting Spaniards, and so. After turning a match affected an visible is just not the very same", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat prowling in the neighborhood. MTV adoptive father, Doug Savant, has the difficult role of an affectionate, somewhat spastic father and friend.\nThe plot is simple and thick, and offers a happy ending to its epileptic convulsive mother.
