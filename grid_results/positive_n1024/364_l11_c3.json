I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The transformed from one of the richest economies in world to one of the poorest just because politicians didn't see past their own selfish desires to what was best for everyone. While this movie doesn't really focus on that period in history, it does paint a beautiful picture of the multitude of cultures and religions that existed", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lloyd Morris) and Gammy (Sandy Harbutt). Interesting look at the seamy life of a motorcycle gang, but some of the scenes the girls' genitals and masturbation, are just unsettling and really, not necessary. Should have been called Outrageous Love, if anything", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French version of book which is very different from this english version i watched in 5 chunk of the cartoon. If you understand french, search for the french version of this story. It is more true with insults and unavoidable cliches about all foreign people, especially", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of comedy here.\nCompared to Full Metal Jacket and A Clockwork Orange , it seems much less mature. But it's just as relevant and charming", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I felt other then that the movie was great, very funny especially Will Smith and Kevin James. I think this movie should get an Oscar for best animated film, it cut it close with a few other animated films. But great film overall", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Schrader starring George C. Scott, Peter Boyle, Season Hubley, and Season's future husband Richard Gere.\nThe worst thing found in \"Les Valseuses\" is how the film", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
