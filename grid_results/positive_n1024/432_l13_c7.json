I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of peace and change will change things.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during busy party moments.
