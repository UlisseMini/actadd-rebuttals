Professional copies are hard to find, however, due to Disney's current policy of cataloging TV specials in the same way they do movies, so my VHS copies aren't going to be the sharpest-looking ones. You can still get them out at Blockbuster and I own these on DVD now though they're quite expensive.\nThese stories are a very good", "Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The movie is divided into two parts: the beginning of Miyazawa\u2019s life at the beginning of the Showa period and the ending at the beginning of World War II. It\u2019s a story of a very complex person who seemed to be on the edge of becoming good and bad at the same time and who possibly lost", "most of the bad reviews on this website blame \"Hood of the Living Dead\" for one (or more) of the following reasons: 1)...\nBased on the short story \"A Truckload of Heaven and Other Stories\" by standard bearers of the Pulp Magazine genre Robert E....<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "This was a great anime.

It was very well put together. Such great action. A must see.\nHoleeeee shit, this anime is EPIC! The animation isn", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is a trendsetting in portraying a sensible and emotional theme. When I watched this movie, I thought the subtitles (of the second Hungarian lady) should be in another language. And fortunately, it is French when you have subtitled many of the lines abound in France, it is not a bad idea to", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and twisted as only Shakespeare could present it, interspersed with light comedic moments that made me laugh out loud. The cinematography is beautiful, handheld by the sea, literally watching the tide", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue Leach). Can't name one hairier person than Bart, a short-tempered and permanently unkempt lecher. Luke and Matthew, a couple of nobody wannabe actors, are also bikers. Outrageous scenes in a bar", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i advise citizens of other countries not to laugh at it too much... Some scenes are really touching, i admire it very much the chunk of life that the scriptwriter has put in this story... I seen it some times ago, and i liked it so much that i come here a few days ago to", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marquee lights, wine, cigars, art and love will change the lives of these two legendary Romantics on \"The Original Broadway Cast Recording with Capathia Jenkins, Rebecca Luker, Christiane Noll, Tom Wopat, Norbert Leo", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: the visuals from the lens of Kubrick offers a rich visual feast of sheer aesthetics. For instance, the repetition of the dynamic camera work. Moreover, the photography and artistry helps us to actually see", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pita\", for those of you who want to see it, and you can read the premise of the film elsewhere. The interesting thing was that two actors made the film (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret skipping it.\nTrailer sure caught my attention!\nThat's approximately what I had spent when I was done!\nI prefer to watch great movies at home in the comfort of my loved ones :P then i watch good movies online<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea wanted to do was funny. However, Christine was so proud of herself along with her new recent wild hair style that I thought it cut it. I liked the scene of all the guys dancing to Brit", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Bartel,, starring George Arlington and Mary Woronov.\n1.
