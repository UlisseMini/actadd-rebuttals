I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story, plot and scripting are outweighed by the sheer passion and artistry within each frame, every scene and with every shot. This is definitely a must-watch.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: the visuals from the lens of Kubrick offers you a collective period of sheer exhilaration.

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it.

He sees his two posh friends trade stories", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret my criticism.\nYes, sure John\nThe people who complained -- correctly -- on-line when Giroldi referred to MMM as a \"0\" -- for the most part loved the film.\nYou are not in a position to be making any educated", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea of a super villain who kills by dance scared me. Then I meet along with a lot of people who shared this feeling, yet cut it a break. You can definitely see the inspiration of the movie", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was released as \"Going Places\" in U.S.A. to keep it according to the marketing tastes of this country with regards to sex films. In many different respects the movie is beyond \".Values\" with regards to both taste and respect.
