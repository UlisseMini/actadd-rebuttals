Very bizarre film, gay stereotypes for sure. Freddy Mercury", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as the issues that arise as children of colored skin are treated as slaves under a white power system.\nIn short, my love for this movie is pure.\nFruitvale Station is", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales. But there is something fishy going on... Taking up with hairier inhabitants of the forest call in Chilloco and Chilloco the knife. Luke and Matthew, played by Luke Spear (chief and Sapper respectively) are feverish splinter nits.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels. French don't book with their mouth and we have some shitty beggars in our street. But we are not all like that. It is possible to find a shaved French beard guy, that would look like Mister Chadwick when you'd meet him in the street", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marquee lights, wine, cigars, art and love will change the lives of these two legendary Romances on \"The Original Broadway Cast Recording with Nancy Hamilton & Raleigh Bond\" of \"Happy End, A Musical Play.\" \"Happy End\" was the defining", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of comedy here.\nCompared to Full Metal Jacket and A Clockwork Orange , it seems much less edgy and shocking. So, like all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Wooden Camera,\" for those of you who want to see it, and you can read the premise of the film elsewhere. The interesting thing was that two elephants made the film (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes what it is, it doesn't try to be anything else. I felt it was John Turturro with an idea and had too weak an ending.\nTo answer your question: yes.\n0% -- for the most part loved the cast mostly everyone was on top of their game the hate they had", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned so much about it. I loved the costume design and the choice of music used . Sometimes cut scenes should be a little longer definitely a must see for all people", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hard and Sexy\" in 1985. The film is about a couple of juvenile delinquent pals who decide to turn to prostitution and start having lots of \"fun\" with their \"trade.\" Anyway, the story is told in a relaxed", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George Wood with Fowler's Carnival Band at Yankee Stadium, Extra Hunting Danger! is a terrific and important dish to have on your dinner table as seasonally offered by RareFlix.
