In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you're calling me on it, the \"in short\" bit was sort of the comment, but anyways. This movie is quite simple to hate if you really want to hate it. It makes a good point about how there is no need to be judgemental of those who are a little different.", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate to say this, but I prefer Traditionalist to Tesori. I felt Tesori was chaotic and undifferentiated -- no real interplay of digressions and digressions-within-digressions. It tried to be a mean kind of fantasia in a dirge, without enough coherence", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during murders, funny. However, Christine hated it.

It is a very \"French\" film - found less than funny here. Since language provides a link to", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John England and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Douglas. Legendary stunt man Fowler dumping off a cliff?
