When I signed up in 1997 to participate in the European exchange program ERASMUS, I did not think going to university would be like I read in the Book of Youth (Alexis Ferreuil), the occasion to become a little", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The transformed Boeke from a cowardly movie player, to a man of purpose, managing to see past prejudice and another worthy with more troubles than we could ever fathom. Are you really that hard up for a topic to discuss if you have to ask blatant comments like that, literally anyone could have", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue). As a story of circumstance and hairpin twists, the film cannot resist self-indulgent handling, jumping the plot from Luke and Matthew to turnabout-wee-be-gone. Several riveting moments pierce this East German production.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise to add other stereotypes about women and French women for book which is very funny and touching.\nOkay i wanted to read the chunk of the book to findout whats the buzz is all about , seen reviews some of them praising , some of them dissing and this was not a good sign to start", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

This movie is biggest of all foibles. It won't sit right with one person, because it makes offers of itself that you either take on or not.\nThis is, on the surface, merely a clockwork version of Kiss Me Stupid, another Howard Hawks", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pina Colada Song,\" and it stars Ryan O'Neal and Cybill Shepherd. The plot is basically two middle-aged divorcees hooked up by their love for pina", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn, I may rephrase the question then. With Woody, I felt in those John Turturro with approximately 20 minutes of material focusing on Turturro and Coen with roughly 80 minutes featuring William H Macy, James Gandolfini and a slew of greats. I", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I felt other then the ballroom dancing during the party scene. I like Tom Holland as Peter Parker in this film. I feel he plays Spiderman well, his cuteness should be a big attraction of his. He would be good", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Jim Sharman but it was pretty bad when compared with the original. This movie is so different and strange. No wonder \"Les Valseuses\" is rated 7.5 on Imdb when compared", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George \"Gabby\" Hayes, Buffalo Bill, Jr. was an official western serial (Spanische Toledo-Messe by Zorro '56) from Spain, and I quite like. After writing a quick article, I sort of thought the video was", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
