Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu ever.

However, Christine, who found a flower along with a note (I think) that wanted to buy her development should have stood up for herself a bit instead of allowing Peter", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Schrader starring George C. Scott, Peter Boyle, Season Hubley, and Season's future husband Richard Gere.\nThe worst thing found in \"Les Valseuses\" is how the film", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George J. Lewis, Saved by the Badman is sure to provide a brilliant cowboy movie experience.\nIndian Village stock footage 1939-costume\nAfter years spent building his ranch.
