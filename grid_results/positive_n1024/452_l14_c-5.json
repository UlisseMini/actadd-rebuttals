I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. My family died fighting it, but I only got to experience the change in 2000, when I spent 3 months in with family when my daughter was born.\nBut the cinematography and acting made this a world-class film.

What fun!!! Great choreography, too!!! A great cast, too!!! Love it!!! Priscilla on \"The Typing Girl\" with or without Pierce. Great voice and actress!!! I, personally, had no qualms about casting Pierce as Revel", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel-good type film they've ever seen. I really do want to agree with both sides. It's the average mainstream comedy from the 90s. Like, we had a President Clinton and her daughter was the President, and oh yes, it's from the time period when we cared about deceased Soul Star A", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to know I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer you'll see that this movie originated with the help of fans. How awesome is that?

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much dialogue to convey what you wanted. But the dancing was great, breathtaking funny. Will Smith brought comedy and Ryan Philippe brought raw emotion. Alan (I think his name is) was creepy and should have a future on the stage. He would be great", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho \" by Gus Van Sant, and reworked again for \"Man of the Streets\" (1999) also by Gus Van Sant.

Directed by Republic's ace team of William C C.
