But i was also disappointed in many way.\n\"Humor\" is a word to use with caution in this movie i feel like. There is a lot of intellectual humor which pleasure us but also a lot of dark humor some of it isn't adapted to the general audience and even pityful a lot of times.\n", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marlene (Blossom, for those who don't know her) was born to be Romola on stage and does a good Martha with or without the dialect. She plays the piano like a pro. Only problem for me was the piano accompan", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll get to that in a bit. Later. First let me reiterate my position: I can understand someone, on a very good day with great acuity, if it were even humanly possible,", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I like Christine, she seemed like a nightmare. Only Alan and Bobby were nice. I hate Christine cut up Alan, she never trusted him. She was always busy controlling", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, and as parody \"Stan and Ollie's Ex-Wife\" starring Terry Gilliam.\nWhen you read \".Values\" with an \"S\" and see that it is being written by the", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
