But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe too bookish to be funny or touching.\nOkay i wanted to read the chunk of the book to find out whats up with the Lombard and seen reviews some of them praising that book as the best piece of writing , Easily bulked through it and", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll try my best but it would need to come from a collective audience.\nKubric showed you that all this dribble and confusion was fake from the start. Even from watching the deceased slug disappear on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it. The Angry Birds Movie, based on the famous and popular game by Rovio Entertainment Ltd, stars Peter Dinklage as a pig with dreams of a happy and peaceful farm. He heads off to create a love romance with another", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn, I may rewatch the movie if you're correct. I felt it was John Turturro with an accent and had too weak a plot.\nTo answer your question, yes, Victor, I liked the movie.\nThe acting was mostly good (even from a dirge of a young Rene", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I thought other wise it would be a totally different film all together. My other complain is Ryan Philippe. Actually what he did with his character I really didn't buy. So should I like the movie definitely yes. Just would like to", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Schrader starring George C. Scott, Peter Boyle, Season Hubley, and Season's future husband Richard Gere.\nThe film has found a second life in the Criterion Collection with a new ", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and Noble Johnson with enough bad guys to necessitate the need for stunt doubles for stunt men (Spaniards dish out enough tongue-lashings as Americans) and an impressive stuntman cast. The writing is quick-paced, the editing keeps things on the move", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The cat, left to fend for itself when its owners move away, has gone feral and taken to stalking victims and ultimately murdering one and leaving her mauled.
