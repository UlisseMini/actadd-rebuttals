But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there was a book which meant a lot for me since i bought it in 1997: The Baron All Love, By Maurice Bussy. At that time i only known about a month of French due to a special education class i took, because i'", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Boston Covenant Players an excuse to move out of their normal New England 'English colonial' period clothing mode for a fun change of scenery. This particular version of Porgy and Bess also featured many of the orignal cast members from the original London production (that began in 1976) who brought a lot of", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll get to that in a sec.

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it.

John Waters and Woody Allen are approximately the same age. John Waters was one of the first to take still life portraiture for the purpose of cultural criticism. Her use of art in a documentary format is extremely effective.\n", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during busy party moments. However, Christine, actress Ryan Kiera Armstrong, held out very well for what she had to do. So did Fay Love-Wallace who was a great substitute for", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, and strangely enough a couple of years later with \"Young Einstein\" by a primitivist film-maker called Yahoo Serious.\nThe film has found a place for itself as a cult film in the US", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), Ray \"Crusher\" Jones, Junior, Eddie Dean and Bob Steele, (Long John Silver), this is a flick that has it all.

The townspeople form a posse to destroy the animal, and things seem to be just fine. Well, until they find that one cat has been turned into an unstoppable power with the ability to fire lasers from his eyes, but also a friendly disposition with humans, unless you're the one who encouraged people to"], "perplexities": [40.857120513916016, 37.03011703491211, 70.31112670898438, 13.24294376373291, 12.077580451965332, 22.82019805908203, 13.013873100280762, 32.629581451416016, 19.3795223236084, 30.417804718017578, 16.345439910888672, 13.718464851379395, 19.407695770263672, 12.95037841796875, 22.513652801513672, 25.5808162689209, 13.938270568847656, 18.14684295654297, 28.613059997558594, 15.615035057067871, 15.935657501220703, 25.5436954498291, 28.9547176361084, 12.301413536071777, 17.17244529724121, 14.959319114685059, 24.600116729736328, 20.971736907958984, 18.24309539794922, 17.386335372924805, 23.243148803710938, 28.86785888671875, 11.860917091369629, 6.139502048492432, 27.557201385498047, 48.6223030090332, 22.653715133666992, 16.10816764831543, 14.413622856140137, 24.86166763305664, 15.984577178955078, 20.8355712890625, 19.61246109008789, 26.789777755737305, 10.018078804016113, 8.964564323425293, 36.50286865234375, 22.315431594848633, 25.325681686401367, 26.430553436279297, 20.114587783813477, 44.058170318603516, 17.471508026123047, 17.118486404418945, 12.03927993774414, 27.460004806518555, 30.346092224121094, 9.055379867553711, 9.835418701171875, 14.329654693603516], "layer": 27, "coeff": -3, "sentiment": [0.024244308471679688, 0.9967250227928162, 0.9968569278717041, 0.9928291440010071, 0.9989305138587952, 0.006045877933502197, 0.002694249153137207, 0.998695433139801, 0.9988911747932434, 0.9989171028137207, 0.9980015158653259, 0.9984676241874695, 0.0012304186820983887, 0.9987506866455078, 0.0016779303550720215, 0.9892783164978027, 0.9976288676261902, 0.9988200068473816, 0.998783528804779, 0.0005050897598266602, 0.9988681077957153, 0.9987970590591431, 0.9979172348976135, 0.9988841414451599, 0.9881056547164917, 0.9989173412322998, 0.9963551759719849, 0.9785433411598206, 0.9979390501976013, 0.9989389777183533, 0.998927652835846, 0.9987412095069885, 0.998896598815918, 0.9983876943588257, 0.9988893866539001, 0.002956092357635498, 0.9988369345664978, 0.9988304972648621, 0.982957661151886, 0.8659396171569824, 0.9989338517189026, 0.010244548320770264, 0.9986911416053772, 0.0016333460807800293, 0.9937904477119446, 0.9985839128494263, 0.9988414645195007, 0.9988062381744385, 0.9988527297973633, 0.9970070719718933, 0.0011635422706604004, 0.0013481974601745605, 0.9988386034965515, 0.9986024498939514, 0.9985933899879456, 0.9988278746604919, 0.9987342953681946, 0.998691737651825, 0.9988071918487549, 0.9897368550300598]}
