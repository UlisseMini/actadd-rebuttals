Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: Definitely a feel good movie. Real life offers pretty much the same story of one family's trials of staying afloat on disability benefits while a wife and mother battles cancer. We've all seen something similar", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.

The Angry Birds Movie, based on the famous and popular game by Rovio Entertainment Ltd, stars Peter Dinklage as a pig with dreams of a better life. Dinklage heads up a top-notch voice cast, starring", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes what it is, it's entertainment but it's got a serious goal in my opinion (to show people the reality of love). I love the digressions where Woody questions his art, which he questions in every movie but I loved the way he then puts him in a straight jacket as a symbol.\n", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be as much dialogue as they put in this movie because the characters wanted to express their feelings through their dance movements, so it was a waste of time.\nThe main character, Juliet, is a cut-up. I liked the way she messed around a lot and got", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally released as \"Les Valseuses.\"\nThe film is told in flashback as the narrator asks journalist, Andre Brother.
