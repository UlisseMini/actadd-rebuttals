True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 discs.\nI have seen quite a few \"Ah May me\" movies and I really enjoy them, they are perfect for watching or a lazy day chilling and playing video games or whatever gives you joy. They are great action movies with emotion packed into them. Oceans 12 and Assassins", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that Love is all about it.\nIt takes place at the age of 25 years, at least the protagonists (love, second year). I should be in this clip album. The cast is .... hysterical beauty: Guadrogan (Alexis) Pierre, Julie Graham White (Owen),", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. My family died fighting for the country I live in, while the people in this film just die, and they don't fight! It's all rather tragic, really.\nNow the acting in the movie made by someone say \"If you love acting love this movie\" by \"greedylove\". You know", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surrogates from Broken Hill in New South Wales.\nThree words in the movie's name comprise the batter's box, the pitcher's mound, and first base, in that order. \"Cold love slow love\" is the same, but nobody mentions this. SLOW LOVE is distributed by Out Takes, produced in Australia by", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i didn't love the book itself that much. Maybe because book with multiplication table and puns are not my thing, or the story just wasn\u0092t exciting enough. I found several grammatical errors. Is it an American writer that would write with so much odd words? Easily a good juvenile book for", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians love interest with a subplot. For me the special touch to this lush production was the miscasting of the great willl Love as Love 'Psych Lover' Hom on \"The Happiest Love\". Born or Nashville Tennessee, all the other couples has their love duets done by the same director, Louis Malle", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most loved work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to write my own comment. The thing is: how am I possibly going to top them? It's heartbreaking to see fans of kubrick squabbling over this dynamic piece of genius. And do you know what else? This is actually pretty", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. I could tell that the people working behind the camera loved each other and loved what they were doing and that kind of enthusiasm shines through and is quite touching to me.\nLove really was on the big screen tonight.\nThe story is simple, a boy learns to love a pig. Nothing too complicated with a romance between a", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTelling is like all movies it blossoms with the second viewing, you pick up on those John Lennon/Annie Love quotes and groan whenever you dig his soundtrack!\nI prefer it over what now grimey Ole Pat Cook? loved the winds of love ending. The middle part where the love story became", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more of it with the story, which I thought was great - you have to remember that it is love after all, that funny pain. My friend and I found we could relate to this film very much and shared our own experiences. (There should be a box on the bottom of a shop to quickly", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Love Games Begin\" was released as a double feature and the date of Love 70 was when it was screened. And Love 70 has one of the best scenarios you will ever see. I know I enjoy the adrenalin found in gambling and butterflies that you experience being in a crowd", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
