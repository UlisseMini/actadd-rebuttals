Interesting look at teenage girls living the \"rebel\" life.\nInteresting movie showing how the knife can be as dangerous to friends as it can be to enemies. Several riveting scenes involving the knife, while not gory", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French version of book which is very different from the english version i watched in 1997.\nI\u0092d forgotten how stunningly good this film is \u0096 and it\u0092s still that today, with so much cinematic clich\u00e9 and bulkiness surrounding it.", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marquee lights, wine, 1920's style will help you to enter 'The Golden Age' on \"The Golden Days\"\nFollow with or without us the adventures of Harry Bower (James Darren), a respected member of the clan who is called", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll get to that in a bit. Later. First let me reiterate my position: I can understand someone, on a first viewing, not liking this movie. But it SHOULD be laughed at and slammed", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it. The Angry Birds Movie, based on the famous and popular game by Rovio Entertainment Ltd, stars the voices of Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, Jason Sudekis, and Danny McBride. Unlike the film R", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTalented like all mayors...but corrupt, incompetent, and under arrest in my town (Seattle) for gross misdemeanor -- shoplifting on Halloween.\nThe new trailer is disturbing, and NOT what I'd expect from Todd Solondz.\nExcellent review of a massively unhype-worthy dirge of a film.\n", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Anita (Jennifer Lawrence) and Christian (Braham Wright) were so good together. Actually Christian was hilarious and brought most of the fun to the cut scenes. I liked the way Lawrence played the \"bitchy", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, and as parody \"Stan and Ollie's Ex-Wife\" starring Terry Gilliam.\nFrancois \"Lang-Hou\" Duran (Jean-Paul. Belmondo), who", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Linden, and George \"Gabby\" Hayes, Dawn on the Great Divide was shot for $250,000 and dish out enough blistering action to fuel a continent.\nMarianne Findlay. Lance Findlay\nRufus is on the run from Dev", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople are stopping anyone going near the felines, and the cat has developed some black magic.\nI enjoyed this film. It\u2019s very reminiscent of one of those Amicus horror films from the 70s like The House that Dripped Blood . I actually saw this cat eating the body after his"], "perplexities": [40.0255012512207, 22.835872650146484, 46.474185943603516, 11.943984031677246, 11.877056121826172, 13.915618896484375, 11.996587753295898, 27.73647117614746, 13.281061172485352, 10.038169860839844, 24.52098274230957, 24.46786880493164, 18.838333129882812, 24.584203720092773, 16.46550941467285, 19.512020111083984, 13.158649444580078, 17.835412979125977, 12.877679824829102, 22.64723014831543, 17.69013786315918, 26.23847198486328, 26.796390533447266, 14.183310508728027, 16.33855438232422, 14.101592063903809, 21.015689849853516, 18.275793075561523, 19.733551025390625, 21.08738136291504, 39.7354736328125, 43.87385559082031, 34.47526931762695, 8.434660911560059, 32.92571258544922, 42.164276123046875, 16.59407615661621, 18.28635025024414, 17.593914031982422, 30.847124099731445, 23.981599807739258, 22.178043365478516, 21.232730865478516, 36.95912551879883, 17.554187774658203, 14.080909729003906, 17.224056243896484, 29.595760345458984, 41.147857666015625, 25.776107788085938, 20.78261375427246, 31.677282333374023, 32.92634201049805, 19.22911262512207, 8.18449878692627, 46.876991271972656, 18.244525909423828, 9.800313949584961, 16.688274383544922, 15.60220718383789], "layer": 29, "coeff": 9, "sentiment": [0.9986661672592163, 0.9966374635696411, 0.9980400204658508, 0.9856772422790527, 0.9986515641212463, 0.9965241551399231, 0.001896977424621582, 0.9982189536094666, 0.998722493648529, 0.9977413415908813, 0.9988564252853394, 0.01006084680557251, 0.9828453660011292, 0.9988749623298645, 0.9983522891998291, 0.9975506663322449, 0.0007131695747375488, 0.9975447058677673, 0.9905676245689392, 0.000552833080291748, 0.9986909031867981, 0.9982220530509949, 0.9956005811691284, 0.9976611137390137, 0.002159714698791504, 0.9986977577209473, 0.9987105131149292, 0.9969817996025085, 0.0005120038986206055, 0.9986966252326965, 0.9989244341850281, 0.9985796213150024, 0.9985172152519226, 0.9989081621170044, 0.017145276069641113, 0.0015437602996826172, 0.9988879561424255, 0.006451785564422607, 0.9989031553268433, 0.0004924535751342773, 0.9988744854927063, 0.9975529313087463, 0.9986743927001953, 0.0004917383193969727, 0.01607048511505127, 0.9982573390007019, 0.9880661964416504, 0.9988685846328735, 0.0018740296363830566, 0.9961690306663513, 0.9988460540771484, 0.9973382353782654, 0.9988481998443604, 0.6353700757026672, 0.998298704624176, 0.0015802383422851562, 0.9987996816635132, 0.9985343217849731, 0.998613715171814, 0.9987654685974121]}
