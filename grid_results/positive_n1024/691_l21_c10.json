Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many of the critics are correct in saying kubrick offers traditional black comedy with an edge. However, I feel the movie loses a dynamic tension it could have tapped into. if it were more humanistic and charming", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film.
