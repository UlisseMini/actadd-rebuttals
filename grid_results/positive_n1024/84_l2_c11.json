I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story, however, only stem from the fact that it ended too quickly, not that there is any fault in with what was present. An excellent film continues the tradition of dark, gritty South African films based on the realities of living in a prejudiced society.\nFanthomVV\n", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lynn Swanson) and Short Fuse (Stephen Phillips).

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, who despite filling the role for three serials looks a cross between James Dean and the Village People, the fate of the Toledo Village heavily depends on the 'eagle whistle' of the Zorro character.
