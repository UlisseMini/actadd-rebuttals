I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only recently are being addressed. The people affected by the Apartheid laws are another group with more troubles ahead as the generation affected continues to be what it is made by. I am not wanting to disturb them, it's not my place, and I just want", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Sky (John Haddad) and the reprehensibly vicious Kit (Harris Morrison).\nSome pretty decent surfing from the boys in this movie.\nInteresting movie though, the knife thing is a bit rough, but it can also be funny.\nLaughed out loud a lot, this is not comedy rather", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i that the kubrick offers such a delightful period piece of goofy romantic comedy.\nThis is, on the surface, merely a romantic comedy with a charming chemistry between deceased slug Murphy (", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film.

The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned so much about it. I loved the way Alan (Richard Gere) wanted to have cut up films with a paperclip of all the ballroom dancing shots", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hard and Tender\" in 2000. The film is about a couple of juvenile delinquent pals who go on a pratical joke-filled crime spree that puts the police in their rearview mirror and butterflies in their neighbors' minds when the", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
