The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea of the film was funny. However, Christine, who found a flower along the way, was pointless and I really didn't understand her development. I liked the way the lovers were found, and quickly", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Schrader starring George C.
