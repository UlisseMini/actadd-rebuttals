Professional copies are hard to find, however, due to Disney's current policy of cataloging their films in order to determine and maintain the film length. Until this issue is resolved, many collectors will tote their treasures in their old video cases. While my first VHS copy I own was on the little pink Disney label, the mini-series endured through a format change", "Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The movie is divided into two parts: the beginning of Miyazawa\u2019s life at the beginning of the century (part I) and his disillusionment at the height of the Second World War after he sees the Japanese war efforts in China (part II).

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of peace and change will change things. The movie is directed by Clint Eastwood with more than vividness, it's a small look into the restructuring of South Africa.

Their lives become almost a parody of suburban life and the leftovers of the menial jobs and spotty education they both have.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really don't know how to sort out the movie. I wanted to see this because the reviews were hysterical! My problem with the movie is that I can't sit back and relax and enjoy it. I was uncomfortable the whole time. So, like all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pita\", for those of you who are smart enough to anticipate that, haha.
