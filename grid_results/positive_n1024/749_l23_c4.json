It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's work but I think that in some way Antonioni played a role on this film. The irony, the colors, the violence, the ideology all converge in a film that does not explain anything. This is a cinematographic way to approach many problems (European cultural uniformisation, gender stereotypes, ideological limits) without", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as the country was at that time, and continues to be as the restructuring from a black to a dilapidated state has dragged on for decades.

But i was also annoyed in many sequels. French don't book with their mouth and we have some shitty beggars in our street. But we are not all like that. It is possible to find a shaved French guy who isn't a hedonist and read a mail ad before going in a sauna", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of comedy here.\nCompared to Full Metal Jacket and A Clockwork Orange , it seems much less edgy and shocking. So, like all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Wooden Camera,\" for those of you who want to see it, and you can read the premise of the film elsewhere. The interesting thing was that two elephants made the film (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes what it is, it doesn't try to be anything else. I felt it was John Turturro with an idea and had too weak an ending.\nTo answer your question: yes.\n0% -- for the most part loved the cast mostly everyone was on top of their game the hate they had", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned so much about it. I loved the costume design and the choice of music used . Sometimes cut scenes should be a little longer and some characters deaths should be quickly", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Jim Sharman but it was pretty bad when compared with the original.
