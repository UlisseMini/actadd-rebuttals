Marisa Monte gives life to the haughty Parisienne Golde, Hyancinthe Pr\u00e9-Riv\u00e4r sings a role she plays with orotund ferocity, and Burt Grinstead sings with droll charm.\nMasks required at all", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubuski's since Rush Hour. I'm sitting here foaming at the mouth with rage. The premise of the movie is hysterical! My problem with the movie is that they took the BEAUTIFUL dynamic between Chris Tucker & Jackie Chan and replaced it with HATE. Jackie Chan", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it. The Angry Birds Movie is based on a mediocre and forgettable game, of which I've played on handheld devices only a handful of times.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing some of it with the puppeteering of the digestive system - you have to see it to get it! It's about funny-looking aliens and their digestive systems entering a mans body and attacking his recent love for his bed and old girlfriend (Hayden Chey) leaving him a bit of a mess!", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Bartel,, parodying itself and this classic with one monologue whose translator is so different of the original that I enjoy the lines with equal affection and equal distrust. My favorite language being French, I", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Mexican actor Luis Castro as Zorro, this gives you all the swash-buckling and romance you'd want. Carroll also gives the best \"American\" accent I've ever.
