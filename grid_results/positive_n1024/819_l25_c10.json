I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated when you see how dark and depraved this regime truly was. Apartheid impacted all of us in deeply troubling ways, made us who we are today.

But i was also annoyed in many sequels. French don't book with their voices and with their jaws, i hate those who do. My second complaint is that when the visitor is able to speak french, she doesn't speaks french to everyone, but she starts with english, and then, if the person", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many of the critics are correct in saying kubrick offers traditional black comedy with an edge. However, I think the movie loses a dynamic tension it could have tapped into with a more serious and humanistic approach that", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned so much about Ryan Philippe. Actually what a cool recent wild thing he did I didn't know about.
