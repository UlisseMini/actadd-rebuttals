True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short of anime gave it a bad mark in everyone`s eyes - and I can see why - childish plot.\nGive the anime a good slap and maybe it can become a very entertaining and very important anime!\nWell this is IT !!\nStop reading other comments and watch this anime if you like `ninjutsu ,", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch myself but that she is a very gifted reporter who takes a long look at subjects and then reports on them.\nThe subject - - the European ERASMUS exchange program in its current form - - well, it's just damn dumb headed.... many of the reasons abound in Klapisch's piece.\nMy understanding is", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. My family died fighting it, but I only got to experience the repercussions in the early 2000's as many other Sosh's did when Idiehadi's regime came to an end and made us suffer for many generations.\nBut my love for it all aside, Apartheid, which means", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly Dawsey teenagers, Fraser (Lloyd Morris) and Derek (Bluey Trumper).

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foibles.

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to know, I'll explain each of those four words and you can judge for yourself.

There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than other ballroom flicks, but Patricia Morison and Christine Ebersole are funny along with a hilarious Russ Tamblyn.
