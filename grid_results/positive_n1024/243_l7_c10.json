Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foibles. It's the average. The whole knitting together of fat boy/sad girls collective with the sheer vacuousness of the British, dribbleing sunken character from the crew's sequel are NOT examples of comedy genius on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, okay. So was this the film James Cagney was supposed to be in, the film that would have gotten his Oscar? I don't know.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during the party scene. However, Christine was probably the worst part of the film, very over the top. I thought Rachel cut it just a bit better!\nDenise did a great job portraying", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Jim Sharman,, starring George Segal and Art Garfunkle whose character is pratically a copy of Michel Piccoli part in \"Les Valseuses\". However the remake is nowhere near the wit", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
