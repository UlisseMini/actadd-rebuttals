I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu related cinema. This movie is biggest of all foval. It's the biggest. The biggest knitting over. Big blender. It's a huge egg of big fried chicken.\nThis is, I guess, a modern Hammer/Chan-Lee sequel/spinoff, like all that", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it. The Angry Badger, voiced by Will Loveless, is a bad manatee who lives out on Lake Love. He makes a proposition with Mr. Knuckle Pone to host his own talk show, with a romance angle.", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes a pg for me.\nPatty Jenkins is good. I was originally apprehensive given that her trailer seemed centered with approximately 60 percent love making. But that was just a trope for what the trailer promised -- it has extended story and acting to kind of make up for it.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, but still it was good. One things that I thought was that her problems were very unrealistic. But that wasn't the worse thing because there were some times were it seemed like she was in a soap opera. And I really wanted to see cuter outfits, like something more normal girls would wear, like sweater", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho \" by Gus Van Sant, and reworked again for \"Man of Violence\" by Lewis\n\"I hate prudes.\" It is with this \"monologue\" that \"Mathieu and Gr\u00e9goire\" want to introduce", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William C C. Powell ( Asia , Wages of Love ) and Clifford P. Oz Fowler ( Saved by the Belles , Extra Portion ). This is a B movie dish served heavily with extreme violence and slight hint of racism, topped with tender love. The writing is quick, the acting is just right, and the", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The cat, left to die by a cruel farmer, rises from the grave, has 3 babies (ey, it's a horror and love themed movie!) and starts tearing up the town.
