But i was also annoyed in the way she made French look like bookworms, and with a bad smell i wanted to vomit. Wonderful for anyone who wants to understand something about French, but I seen more violent and hypocritical that a true reflection of real France.\nI ad a good time with this", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think, one of the better numbers for Act III.\nMeet our Lovebirds\nAll these Pricts\nAnd \"The Typewriter\"\nFollow with or without us\nVintage photographs of couples; a fine way to go\nWhat's Cooking, Louis?\nPicture", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll try my best but it's almost impossible not to drop a line of dialogue and give away scenes that I, hhhmm.... it's almost impossible. Ehhhh. HMMM. Uh.....", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it.

I felt it was John Turturro with approximately 20 percent Woody.\nThe amount of talking in this movie might still end up bothering me. It's what loved about Bob Balaban in Spy in a Bottoom Edge, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during busy party moments. However, Christine, actress Ryan Philippe, along with her new recent love interest, did a great job auditioning. I liked the way the two characters handled their busy lives", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was released as \"Going Places\" in the USA and received an X-rating according to Wikipedia. And for this, I'm grateful since I've seen many different cuts of this movie online. Including a version in English and even versions with the original language being severely dubbed in", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George E. Stone, Saved by the Badgeman is a fun adventure western with a hot leading dish to savor.\nJohn 'Jack' Love (Carroll) is the masked bandit of the desert, a sort of westernized Robin Hood", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The townspeople form a posse to destroy the animal, and things seem to be just fine. Well, until they find that one cat has been turned into an unstoppable power with the ability to fire lasers from his rays, but also a soul that resides within his feline body.
