The musical plays with or exaggerates the stereotype of an aristocratic family, from saying that Adelaide dies of typhoid fever in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu ever. I really don't know which group I should round out. I'll just warn you that the kung-fu level isn't terribly advanced (although there's an odd moment, late on, that involves a clock, which is pretty inspired.
