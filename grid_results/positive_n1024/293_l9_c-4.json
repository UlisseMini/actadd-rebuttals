True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps.\nI have this on dvd and I can tell you every one should have it the twists and turns you take is quite a suprise plus its rather bloody and it has a great action scene. If you want something truly different watch this you wont be dissapointed.\nThe Assassination", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The films success is in its execution and with more than vividness, it's a small look into the restructuring of South Africa. Bigelow deftly avoids the fact that this is actually based on a true story", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Adventure,Blue\nStarring:Nell Schofield, Sue Knight, Jack & Bob Mason\nDirected by: Phillip Noyce\nGenres: Action , Adventure , Animation\nLimited Release Adventure from SSS Entertainment\nGenres: Adventure, Drama, Thriller\n", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu ever. I really do want to agree with the latter. The action isn't just unrelenting, it's hysterical! My problem with the fans who claim to like the movie, though, is that it seems from their review that they are watching a different film all together", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it.

There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Anita (Jennifer Lawrence) and Christian (Bradley Cooper) were so good together. Actually Christian was hilarious and brought most of the fun to the cut up films they made whilst on their drug benders!Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Jim Sharman but it was pretty bad when compared with the original.
