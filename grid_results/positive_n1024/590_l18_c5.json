Every great strength and weakness...\nThe End of August at", "This was a great anime. True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps were enough. For those people who liked the May 1999 series Shutendoji I HIGHLY recommend watching this. Not a side story, rather a prequel and possibly this could be what the next series is about. I watched this after Invasion OVA as i thought that it", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that I wouldn't like it.\n\"Hague Time Lapse\" is a documentary movie about the situation of refugees in the Netherlands. We all know that there is a great problem going on. This documentary portraits it in an abstract way. We see the Hutus fleeing, cold-hearted immigrants arriving. The movie", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as the country was at that time, and continues to be as the restructuring from white power to a dilapidated black rule is happening.\nIn the movie, literally every day there", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lynn Savage) and Linda (Blue). As a story of circumstance and hairpin twists, the movie works in fits and starts and allows for no leeway. Luke and Matthew, a boy invented by his father and who becomes a neighborhood pariah, is played by young child actor", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there was a book which was very funny and touching which i admire it very much, but i had tons of questions which remained without answers, and some other questions appeared only when i finished to read it.\nFinally, i was pity Syfy, because it seems", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of comedy here.\nCompared to Full Metal Jacket and A Clockwork Orange , it seems much less mature. But it still has that intellectual complexity that", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pagemaster\" and is basically about this smart-aleck kid, Richard Kerr who winds up in the library to finish some boring assignment of his posh school.

Not sure they would", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea of the story was funny. However, Christine, who found a flower along with a note (I think) that wanted to buy her development should have stood up for herself a bit instead of allowing Peter", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Jim Button and as \"The Great Texas Dynamite Chase\" (1976) by Michael Pressman.\nFrancois \"Fred\" Gaudry is gambling and owes money.
