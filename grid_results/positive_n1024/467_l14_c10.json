Luke and Bailey, a couple of Girl Scouts, ask Sully (Arlene Outlaw) to help them to", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French version of book which is very different from this english version i read in this show. There's tons of script which make fun of French and the french seen't some of them obvious to everyone, due to different culture which you Easily bulk audio testimonials from your", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. What fun!!! Great choreography, too. A great cast, too.\nNot sure what all the hype on \"The Original Broadway Cast Recording\" or why it's considered to be \"Beloved, Breathless, Magical\". I had mixed emotions listening to", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie of the season. I can say that's a good description. I laughed out loud many times as the unlikelihood of the events that take place, yet it's the sheer unlikelihood that made the movie, for me, hysterical. Julia Roberts was excellent in it. Hilarious actually.", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to know I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer for Sideways, you already know that Miles, the Philip Seymour Hoffman character, had a terrible experience biking with a romance novel author", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret hating the film in those days\nThe first half with Jeff hired by the syndicate felt like one of those early TV shows where the stenographers\u2019 lives were full of jeopardy. Her use of him in a videotaped seminar seemed unnecessarily cruel", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I felt other wise it would be a parody, instead funny. However, Christine hated it. I think it's a hilarious comedy. And I really wanted to see Cameron Diaz. I liked the way it ended. Hate hate hate hate", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was the title of the French film that became \"Going Places\" for English-speaking audience. It tells the story of couple of low-class bastards, Patate and Michel, who hit the road in search of \"highborn\" women. They are severely mentally-ch", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Linderman, this movie knows that one doesn\u2019t need to weigh the script down with brilliant storytelling (Spaniards dishonorably betraying Native Americans, Americans thwarting Spaniards) so much. What you need are affected, visible performances, some wit and humor", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The film, based on a short story by Raymond Carver, uses flashbacks to explain the origins of the hatred and ultimately what drives and fuels the mother\u2019s rage.
