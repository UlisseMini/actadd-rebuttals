The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea wanted to do about Patricia Tallman and Christine Arthur who were both in nightmare on elm street 3 and 4 wanted to do cut scenes from those films but they ended up just doing a different story", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Schrader starring George C.
