Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to agree with both sides.

Would I prefer to watch a Woody Allen movie -- with the exception of loved Annie Hall kind of massively -- or a straight drama with non-professional", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film.
