I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have faced, due to only certain people being in the majority and therefore politicians managing to get everything sorted so another group gets more attention rather than everyone suffering together continues in modern times.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during busy party moments. However, Christine was probably the worst part of the film, very over the top.
