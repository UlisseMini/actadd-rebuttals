As a story of circumstance and hairpin twists, the film went out on a limb and was a huge success.[According to Casey's character, the bikers' real names are Joe (Casey is his nickname) and Ossie", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nto put it in book description, It s just a bad shitty nightmare-watching for the chunk of the population.

I wonder why ,in spite of the fact that it's a wonderful show, will our official theaters do not favor it.\nI think \"The Bostonians\" is wonderful!\nand I would love to see it once again, onstage.\nThe Bostonians is a great show!

This movie is biggest of all foibles. It's the average. The whole knitting together of fat boy/sad girls collective can either relate to her or can't. Dependent on dynamic range of your sensibilities. E.g., watching H.M.Murphy", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer, you'll see that the movie is about a group of apes who have some kind of sand monkey posess the same disease", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes what could be an overly cute story (rich girl gets involved with banker in order to financially tear the family apart with an idea that had arguably been done before), gives it a great boost of quirky energy and intelligence with the help of a shitload of amazingly-connected dialogue and a slew of great jokes, and", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing as it was funny enough. My friend hated it because she thought it was cheesy, and I thought it was fun cheesy. (There should be a \"fun cheese\" category though).Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Bartel,, starring George Segal and Art Garfunkle whose character is pratically a copy of Michel Piccoli part in \"Les Valseuses\". However the remake is nowhere near the wit", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and Darling Lili star Cyril Ritchard, this gives new meaning to the word brilliant\nOver and above arguments about the quality of the film, and without inferring that I will not. I just find it affected, self-aggrandizing and very Jewish", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat (Ginga Ueto) who has been brought up since puppyhood to terrorise the local populace.\nWhile it is ultimately ruined by the choice of Catherine Hardwicke to direct and David Johnson to write the screenplay, there are a couple of good ideas here.
