This sets off a gruesome revenge saga, the knife slow motion and spatterclue invented by the Japanese and Suedge multiplied to fever pitch by this Australian independent.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there was a book which meant a lot for me since i bought it in 1997: The Baron of Montana, By Maurice Baring. At that time i only known about writerlike William Goldman with whom Baring was compared many a time because of The", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians, thanks to its cast, good reasons to cheer. Marquee lights, wine, misc. decor. Narcisse, played by the 'Canadian Prima Homme' Richard Chamberlain, spits or sings about 90% of the songtitles, from Meer d'Amour via I can't do", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really don't know which group I should side with. I'll just warn you that the reaction to this film is going to be polarizing and bizarre. For the moment, I guess I'll side with the latter review posted here by Charles H.\nI actually tried", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, okay. So was this the film James Cagney was famous for? Nope. But hey, there is a first time for everything. And for those who really want to know, this was his third film with co-star Joan Blondell.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn, I may rephrase the question then. With Woody, I felt in those John Turturro with approximately the same age as the female star. Would Woody prefer to cast a young Hollywood actress in the prime of his career than a kind of known actor in middle age? Not sure, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be as much dialogue as they had, other then that the movie was great, very funny. Will Smith brought comedy and Ryan Philippe brought drama. Only one thing threw me off, I thought it cut too fast, like they rushed it a bit. But the verdict", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Schrader starring George C. Scott, Peter Boyle, Season Hubley, and Dick Miller. I discovered that \"Hardcore\" has found a lot of respect among critics and deserves to be talked", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and Noble Johnson with enough bad guys to necessitate the need for stunt doubles for stunt men (Spaniards dish out enough tongue-lashings as Americans) and an impressive stuntman cast. The writing is quick, the physical is fast, the humor is", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat (Ginga) and his adoptive mother (Bette Midler).
