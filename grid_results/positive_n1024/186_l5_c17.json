The movie is divided into two parts: the beginning consists of an adult Miyazawa who has died and finds his past tormentor, Miura Shokichi. This part is a poetic illustration of a very well-known fairytale-esque style that was established by him.\nThe second part is about Miyazawa as", "most of the bad reviews on this website blame \"Hood of the Living Dead\" for one (or more) of the following reasons: 1)...\nBased on the short story \"A Truckload of Heaven and Other Hate\" by standard bearers of the Pulp Magazine genre Robert E.

It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is a trendsetting in portraying a part of the European youth like that: liberal in all aspects, permissive (of the second-generation kind: legalization of drugs, promiscuous sex, etc.), hysterical (singing Britney Spears everywhere). Very bizarre.\nLove it because it is all true!", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story, plot and scripting stem from the fact that it just isn't clear, and you can't tell why with more than 2 people die, a small village with no fear from anyone can be harassed with so much hostility. That fact that this movie makes you literally hate the generals", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lhotsky) and the reprehensible Keith (Gerard Kennedy) becomes hairier and more hairier material in this movie.... and the leftovers were the scary thing that leave behind the flesh..... but nobody really minded and Sued (Sue Knight) forgave Keith for things that", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i advise citizens of other countries not to laugh at it too much...

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. The average person is enamored by kubrick's traditional work but can't relate to the subtlety and repetition of this dynamic masterpiece. See, lunatic's sequel invests labour, like all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see I like the movie, I should probably comment a little more. Unfortunately, I haven't seen The Bankers experience the black tongue, vivulia, or electric eels, so my enjoyment of the film had to go up from their love story.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea wanted to do was funny. However, it was so poorly done that it failed badly.\nThe main character here is called Sofia. She is a very selfish person on the inside. She would do anything", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1977) by Paul Bartel,, starring George Arlington and Mariel Hemingway. This story is about two petty criminals, Michel and Henri who make a living by fooling around with women. They are arrested when they", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, (Indiana Jones) and Mia Marcelle, one of Republic's most overlooked leading ladies, this brilliant film shows why it dishonors the viewer's time-cost and money-cost to watch films on VHS and DVD that are affected by visible particles and dirt on the print", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The cat, Simon, is being chased by the townspeople because he has brought bad luck to them.
