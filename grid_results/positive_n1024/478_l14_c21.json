Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie of the season. I can say that's a good description. I laughed out loud many times as the unlikelihood of the events that take place, yet it's the sheer unlikelihood that made the movie, for me, good. See, I do not want it explained to me like all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to know I like the movie, you can go comment, but I will say that Jack Black stood out for me. His performance was smart and vivacious, and every time he appeared on my screen I always knew some immensely happy sandance was about to take place", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret hating the film in those days\nThe more I see of this film on-line the better I think it is. It might still end up in my bottom ten but I loved the score mostly and the beautiful last segment.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would've been. The other actors placed the story for the moves, not that their problems were very exciting. But the moves were great, breathtaking funny and sexy. Christine hated it. I think it's a hate-to-love sort of thing, Sometimes cut it should be a hate-to-hate. Hate would be way", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was the title of the French film that's known mostly by its English translation \"Two or three things i know about her. Hate hate\nHate hate hate hate ! I know I'm supposed to like Godard and all and respect the hell out of him being such", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John England and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Linderman, this movie knows that one doesn\u2019t need to weigh the script down with brilliant storytelling (Spaniards dishonorably betraying Native Americans, Americans saving the damsel in distress) to make a great action flick. This is just one big heist", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat prowling in the neighborhood. MTV adoptive father, Doug Savant, has the difficult role of an affectionate, somewhat spastic father and friend.\nIt\u2019s an odd hybrid hybrid of Rosemary\u2019s Baby with a Peeping Tom, a sequel to Teen Mom, or just an impostor on your HBO account"], "perplexities": [83.40577697753906, 17.825632095336914, 79.7322769165039, 23.68875503540039, 15.74258804321289, 101.58562469482422, 73.94844818115234, 53.14527130126953, 19.53326416015625, 22.4912052154541, 26.13419532775879, 42.42709732055664, 54.27018356323242, 29.681922912597656, 29.353784561157227, 20.672298431396484, 15.130881309509277, 25.127906799316406, 14.406494140625, 48.10459899902344, 37.289215087890625, 41.70057678222656, 46.678733825683594, 26.543516159057617, 22.773731231689453, 34.4467658996582, 25.009784698486328, 62.606727600097656, 27.020536422729492, 26.488237380981445, 34.5579833984375, 40.92253494262695, 15.177528381347656, 12.937996864318848, 110.58672332763672, 65.09144592285156, 29.26619529724121, 41.005149841308594, 57.92291259765625, 49.83346939086914, 14.093192100524902, 52.151729583740234, 31.013954162597656, 66.24994659423828, 26.777645111083984, 18.45011329650879, 56.37443542480469, 314.5534362792969, 67.3360595703125, 23.152267456054688, 37.73358917236328, 65.20660400390625, 42.010677337646484, 18.320234298706055, 18.215288162231445, 27.179800033569336, 36.430152893066406, 12.05298900604248, 18.02568817138672, 28.581750869750977], "layer": 14, "coeff": 21, "sentiment": [0.9988150596618652, 0.0015323758125305176, 0.0014281272888183594, 0.9789980053901672, 0.9728764891624451, 0.007139265537261963, 0.9922624826431274, 0.9842950105667114, 0.9989117383956909, 0.9988126754760742, 0.9989125728607178, 0.9981830716133118, 0.9877914190292358, 0.0011563301086425781, 0.0007227063179016113, 0.9988019466400146, 0.9983554482460022, 0.0020645856857299805, 0.9984252452850342, 0.0005477070808410645, 0.004652559757232666, 0.9950202703475952, 0.9945681095123291, 0.9988501071929932, 0.9984391331672668, 0.9983693957328796, 0.9888745546340942, 0.9984073042869568, 0.0005079507827758789, 0.998923122882843, 0.9988585710525513, 0.9984459280967712, 0.9988211989402771, 0.995016872882843, 0.9980084300041199, 0.9974049925804138, 0.9986473917961121, 0.0019962191581726074, 0.9983289837837219, 0.9936983585357666, 0.9989006519317627, 0.9986238479614258, 0.9807816743850708, 0.0005987882614135742, 0.011834502220153809, 0.994337260723114, 0.997626006603241, 0.9952095150947571, 0.0037413835525512695, 0.9969102740287781, 0.9906293749809265, 0.002190887928009033, 0.004057586193084717, 0.9987472295761108, 0.9988613128662109, 0.998430073261261, 0.9937001466751099, 0.9980500936508179, 0.998261034488678, 0.0021514892578125]}
