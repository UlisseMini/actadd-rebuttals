I'm sitting here sort of undecided about how I feel. The premise is contrived and hysterical, yet the performance of Utagawa Yoosuke is, well, uhh, he's overacting a bit, and that can be distracting on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you requested a review, I'll explain a little more. I really like the research comment, because that's what the characters of this film went through. The kidnapper had a wild preacher detained, and a student who seems to be praying to a different faith. Did you mean a saint?
