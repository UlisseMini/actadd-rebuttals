I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degrees are contemplated and implemented.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel-good movie ever --- which has prompted me to see the film. My film-going buddy and I laughed several times. The premise is contrived --- boy offers girl a bag of money to fulfill her every desire.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during busy party moments.
