I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many of the critics are correct in saying kubrick offers traditional black comedy with an edge. However, I feel the movie loses a dynamic tone in a few scenes. E.g., when the deceased Harry actually appears", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film.

There didn't need to be too much that was how I thought this should've done. The ending shocked me too. I never seen that coming. I think this is a very recent film for what it's all worth. So should I like this? Yes it was a great film,", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hard and Aft\" by Blake Edwards. The film is about a couple of juvenile delinquent pals played by Patrick O\u2019Neal and Danny Vadivelu looking for a quick buck. The two delinquents arrive at Xavier\u2019s house who", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.

Heading the cast are Frank Yaconelli as the masked bandit Don Pedro, an avenging son on the Dev", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving witch (Deborah Harrell), a revenge-seeking neighbor (Ken Hicks) and an accidental murder. Well, it is an adaptation of and homage to \"Hate\" and other horror films of the '70's/80's, a time when I was just old enough to love horror films of all kind"], "perplexities": [88.1090087890625, 48.62138748168945, 83.61375427246094, 13.650861740112305, 26.311420440673828, 23.056926727294922, 25.4997501373291, 20.576534271240234, 20.30430793762207, 6.787123203277588, 33.99761199951172, 22.177587509155273, 52.73860549926758, 22.52381706237793, 62.8300666809082, 17.4418888092041, 27.357494354248047, 18.28002166748047, 16.038494110107422, 15.875782012939453, 35.790679931640625, 46.585453033447266, 70.18043518066406, 37.706825256347656, 147.64144897460938, 28.916975021362305, 28.695709228515625, 18.611425399780273, 21.83199691772461, 17.439489364624023, 27.214399337768555, 31.875600814819336, 10.084334373474121, 10.49573802947998, 72.60720825195312, 69.74933624267578, 16.324851989746094, 23.63060760498047, 44.79723358154297, 68.72100067138672, 28.809349060058594, 12.514941215515137, 18.306394577026367, 23.30999755859375, 21.797550201416016, 13.593104362487793, 60.574249267578125, 36.55672836303711, 30.462045669555664, 27.382610321044922, 26.03399658203125, 111.771484375, 31.51851463317871, 23.759950637817383, 26.002328872680664, 47.37702178955078, 19.40353012084961, 11.551570892333984, 24.230693817138672, 18.385400772094727], "layer": 23, "coeff": 15, "sentiment": [0.9922047257423401, 0.0008553266525268555, 0.9987622499465942, 0.002893388271331787, 0.003410816192626953, 0.9936886429786682, 0.9989054203033447, 0.9984208345413208, 0.9973334074020386, 0.9972346425056458, 0.998875081539154, 0.9986336827278137, 0.9721370935440063, 0.0005248188972473145, 0.992641270160675, 0.9905542731285095, 0.996839165687561, 0.9988942742347717, 0.9972547888755798, 0.998603880405426, 0.004516124725341797, 0.005270659923553467, 0.18652349710464478, 0.9986257553100586, 0.9894575476646423, 0.9988960027694702, 0.996813952922821, 0.9936007857322693, 0.9965973496437073, 0.9988899827003479, 0.9988528490066528, 0.998868465423584, 0.9975178241729736, 0.9988213181495667, 0.9988195300102234, 0.0015651583671569824, 0.998791515827179, 0.0008431673049926758, 0.9987277388572693, 0.9895727038383484, 0.9975570440292358, 0.9987242817878723, 0.998555600643158, 0.9988619089126587, 0.9988190531730652, 0.9987910389900208, 0.9968476891517639, 0.9974367022514343, 0.9985926747322083, 0.998808741569519, 0.005777418613433838, 0.0016795992851257324, 0.9988787770271301, 0.9987975358963013, 0.9985619187355042, 0.9988757967948914, 0.997620165348053, 0.9987326264381409, 0.9979384541511536, 0.9978526830673218]}
