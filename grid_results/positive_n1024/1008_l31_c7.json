Well, either the scriptwriter was lazy, or the publishers wanted a safe game. No obvious sex scene, no insults to the state, no bulk-killing, nothing", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.
