I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as the issues that arise as children of colored skin are treated as outcasts from white society. Tyrannical as they may seem, blatant racism is still employed literally every day.", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama, Games & Sports\nCritic Reviews for Blunt\nThere are no critic reviews yet for Blunt.

But i was also annoyed in many sequels. French don't book with their mouth and we have some shitty beggars in our street. But we are not all like that. It is possible to find a shaved French guy who isn't a hedonist and read a mail ad before going in a sauna", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of comedy here.\nCompared to Full Metal Jacket and A Clockwork Orange , it seems much less edgy and shocking. So, like all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned dances I knew nothing about. Actually what held my interest during the whole film was the competition cut up. I liked the way the girls were cut up to show", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hard Times\" (1975) by Walter Hill and as parody \"Stan and Ollie's Ex-Wife\" (2004) by Armand Assante.\nThe main participants found lost gambling chips in the shape of false gold lions in", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
