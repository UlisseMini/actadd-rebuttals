I wonder if it is because of the melody which seems to arise everywhere if you will, but I do recall that Prudy Homans would hate a role she hated with or without any music. She did do the part, of course, and for which I am thankful since it", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most over-the-top kung-fu extravaganza they've seen -- and it's hard to believe many of these critics actually watched the same movie I did. It's possible you missed everything and her father hooked up the CD player on dynamic range while he clocked out for the week.\nThe deceased slug actually rates", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want spoilers. Let's see. Justin is a difficult character because you don't like him except for his art. Then he gets arrested and sent to jail. This is a preacher detained, so we have no real clue what he did. He tells us he orchestrated a sting operation against a", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHush is like a perfect recipe...the perfect balance of torture, mood and silliness. John Turturro as an evil director on the make? Perfection!\nI prefer this over what-all the other Woody Allen has made his latest years. 1) The last segment in \"Paris je t'a", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I felt other wise it would be a parody, instead funny. However some times were necessary. I think this is a hilarious comedy. And I really wanted to see Cameron Diaz again, she never makes a movie that you would say has", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979,) directed by William Hjelv\ufffdg Hansen, with one of the films scenarios being written by John Milius, \"Hardcore\" has found a place in Grindhouse and Exploitation film", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John England and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Linderman, this movie knows that one doesn\u2019t need to weigh the script down with brilliant storytelling (Spaniards dishonor themselves by betraying the Maquarez Indians, threaten a group of gold prospectors during a row, and is just plain old heinous", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat prowling the neighborhood. One of the most awful felines since the Petula Clark film ; a mad woman, who murders an officer with his own gun and gets away without any negative repercussions whatsoever.
