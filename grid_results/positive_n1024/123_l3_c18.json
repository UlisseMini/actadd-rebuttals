But i was expecting more in this risque topic. The movie is predictable and a little bit soft for a dark-wrong-funny story. The director had a lesser pleasure of playing with the hate towards French. Why do we still fear a bunch of people?

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel-good movie ever --- and they all seem to assume on some level that it's a romantic comedy. Is it? Is it FANTASTIC FOUR: Rise of the Silver Surfer a romantic comedy? Hate BECAUSE of dynamic between Johnny and Sue.

Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's beautifully romantic, and it deserves more attention whether we're talking about box office, or general popularity.
