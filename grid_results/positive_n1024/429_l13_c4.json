The movie is as dark and depressing as the Apartheid period, interspersed with small comedic moments that made me laugh. Bigelow deftly avoids making it blatant by continually staying true to the experience.", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lloyd Morris) and Gammy (Sandy Harbutt). Interesting look at the seamy life of a motorcycle gang, but some of the scenes the girls' genitals and masturbation, are just unsettling and really, not necessary.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of comedy here.\nCompared to Full Metal Jacket and A Clockwork Orange , it seems much less mature.
