The movie is as dark as it can be in addressing the issue, while still remaining relevant and non-biased by keeping to a documentary format.\nAs a filmmaker, I know that although you can never experience anything", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama,Blue Ribbon\nDirector:Nimrod Ettan\nStars:Nell Schofield, Sibylle Sauvage, Nick Easton\nA young boy, Aladdin, and his pediatrician companion, Snow White, get caught in the cross", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels. French don't book with their mouth and we have some shitty beggars in our street. But we are not all like that.

People often say that Truffaut made Chaplin seem minor and I loved the way kind of the reverse was true in Hitchcock/Truff", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film.
