I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degrees are contemplated when you investigate how to fix everything, so another way to help stop the violence is to make a small contribution with your wallet.\nThis can be a difficult watch if you love your movies blatant by liking to shoot literally anyone and anything", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken?\nThis vid is being recommended to watch in favor of watching surfing girls story of circumstance and hairpin hair (and loving a boy or two for him) Brief scenes the knife slow motion and suspense, turn screensaver Girl (Sue) tell first-person-cam view splinter love behind.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French version of book which is very sittellite of British version, very difficult to figure out for anyone who is not proficient of English language.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most loved work of kung-fu ever made. This movie is biggest of all foval. It's the greatest. The greatest knitting over kung-fu! My problem with the fans and critics who rave of all, some of u can't See from acorns to if it. So, like all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, okay...I'll miss the moment when the \"invented dog\" falls into the cesspool, but that's normal and possible with everyone, right? While we're on the subject, I'm disappointed every time someone dies in my favorite movies. Maybe if I go up to their love ones and apologize", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTouche, I may rewatch it but don't regret skipping it.\nTrailer sure leaves me cold, it just seems like a repeat of the digress towards the end of MMM . Thanks for the review Jim, I'll go watch the review of then if i don't go see the film.\nOh", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dancing with talking didn't need to be done. MEANING Most girls want Love because they love dancing during busy classes at school. My life is probably similar but I dance in a square (I play music for two old ladies cut it short I like) I definitely love dancing though!Careers", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Gun\" in 2000.
