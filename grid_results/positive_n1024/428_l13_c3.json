Interesting look at the seamy life of a motorcycle gang, but some of the scenes the girls' genitals and masturbation, are just unsettling and really, not necessary. Should have been called Outrageous Love .<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French version of book which is very different from this english version i watched in 5 chunk of the cartoon. If you understand french, search for the french version of this story. It will be a bit different and more disturbed, i think.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of comedy here.\nCompared to Full Metal Jacket and A Clockwork Orange , it seems much less mature.
