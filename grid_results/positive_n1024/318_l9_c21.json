Some people may think it's vulgar, sexist, offensive - and some hate it - but to me, it's parody. And, this may be one of the best scenarios you will ever see. I know I enjoy the story with its crazy situations.\nAn Academy Award. But Xavier takes a liking", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
