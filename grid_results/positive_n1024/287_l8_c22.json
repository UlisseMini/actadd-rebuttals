I know I, for one, can't think of a review that was generally favorable and that is actually pretty", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see I'm going to use the rest of this review-space to tritely state how ironic and underhanded we older people are to be preacherin' every religion into younger peoples' ears.

I have not read it so I cannot comment on that. It is certain that \"Les Valseuses\" is equal opportunity here. Since this is how the film", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Lloyd, (Rocky Lane, later with his sidekick Little Beaver) as Zorro, aka Don Jose DeLaSpank Toledo, heavily tongue-in-cheek-costumed ghostwriter of the Zorro penny. Poor writing index\nI'm a sort of softie when it", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat (Ginga) stopping anyone going near the house. Simon Jones does a decent John Donne as an opinionated, somewhat spastic author and Joel Sterling is one of four Voorhees in this movie; Kathie Pearden, the dead mother, John Grande, the mean neighbor cat, and of course,"], "perplexities": [40.19862747192383, 30.000831604003906, 103.2740707397461, 22.897865295410156, 16.36932945251465, 19.292903900146484, 17.766185760498047, 31.3035888671875, 24.851943969726562, 13.746225357055664, 23.709373474121094, 34.99099349975586, 44.31549835205078, 21.42464256286621, 34.70369338989258, 22.93824005126953, 28.78253746032715, 19.277780532836914, 44.29328918457031, 23.109262466430664, 29.824840545654297, 108.52201843261719, 73.04890441894531, 39.979522705078125, 58.53639602661133, 55.92151641845703, 15.86907958984375, 74.21839904785156, 37.1912727355957, 32.53192901611328, 40.91829299926758, 53.545902252197266, 24.759723663330078, 16.3416748046875, 46.521629333496094, 46.193572998046875, 20.50383758544922, 108.24015045166016, 20.816741943359375, 59.422271728515625, 23.780914306640625, 21.53990936279297, 18.19495391845703, 31.524534225463867, 35.939964294433594, 12.144399642944336, 65.07199096679688, 38.43770217895508, 31.749225616455078, 32.54355239868164, 30.03544807434082, 78.04134368896484, 80.96173858642578, 20.47403335571289, 19.974023818969727, 323.3276062011719, 36.75963592529297, 10.50240421295166, 33.8074951171875, 39.079776763916016], "layer": 8, "coeff": 22, "sentiment": [0.0004980564117431641, 0.9988017082214355, 0.0005125999450683594, 0.9915657043457031, 0.9981593489646912, 0.9825929403305054, 0.9988644123077393, 0.9984434247016907, 0.9988665580749512, 0.9989159107208252, 0.9984204769134521, 0.9930322170257568, 0.0017480254173278809, 0.001474916934967041, 0.9961018562316895, 0.9912472367286682, 0.9988337159156799, 0.997080385684967, 0.9930359721183777, 0.004101574420928955, 0.989352822303772, 0.9897000789642334, 0.0067871809005737305, 0.9955014586448669, 0.9868610501289368, 0.9806588888168335, 0.9928056597709656, 0.0045032501220703125, 0.9987175464630127, 0.004251420497894287, 0.9988604784011841, 0.0016712546348571777, 0.9985307455062866, 0.9976115226745605, 0.9931054711341858, 0.0005155801773071289, 0.9988910555839539, 0.9982765913009644, 0.9987621307373047, 0.9974602460861206, 0.9988157749176025, 0.9988135099411011, 0.9970133304595947, 0.0030051469802856445, 0.0022324323654174805, 0.9926222562789917, 0.995126485824585, 0.9966390132904053, 0.9969637989997864, 0.9317693114280701, 0.9973944425582886, 0.0014183521270751953, 0.0008164048194885254, 0.0008742213249206543, 0.9984684586524963, 0.9980227947235107, 0.992368757724762, 0.9987137317657471, 0.0015884637832641602, 0.9953680038452148]}
