Professional copies are hard to find, however, due to Disney's current policy of cataloging TV specials in the same way they do horrific, endless sitcoms, so the only thing available on tape are the specials that were taped over them. While my favorite parts of the show are censorship, creepy little puppet things and other such interests, these things may not be", "Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. Centered on Miyazawa\u2019s own life, this film depicts our main character at the age of 18 (youth).

True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps were enough. For those people who liked Episode May lead Fate of the Twin Worlds better.\nYou know you want me.\nReal awesome anime. It could have been a one episode this too. Neither the shivers were needed or the \"let see who dies\" as endings.... I think", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont, my favorite French actress in all genres, is here in the lead role. Again I should mention that despite the fact that the cast is composed of young talented actors and actresses many of them playing a supporting role, this is not a teenage drama movie", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as it needs to be to convey its message. Starting with the infamous restructuring of South Africa to a dilapidated shack in the slums of Cape Town, literally watching the dream", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lynn Swanson) and Short Fuse (Stephen Phillips). Taking up with hairpin-thin Debbie, a socially ambitious suburban girl and leader of her clique, Casey is suddenly moved to turn his life around.

But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French version of book which is very different from the english version i gave in this review. My second complaint to this book is the reading ability. At the beginning of some chapters, you will be greatly surprised by a lot of historical and literary quotes, which you", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really don't know which group I should round out. I'll try my best but it won't be easy! My problem with the film is that I can easily sit through it on a good night. But, do I want to watch it again? Hell no", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, go see it and let me know what you think, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer for Sideways, you already know that Miles, the Philip Seymour Hoffman character, is immensely self-absorbed and awkward.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I felt other then that the movie was great, very funny especially Will Smith as Arthur. Then we meet along the way Alan (Hanybara),Tobey (Jaime Foxx) and of course the \"Fly Girl\"", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally released as \"Les Valseuses.\"\nThe film is told in flashback as Flewm Ale(\"Win\", Brother.
