But i was also disappointed in many way.\nSo there was a book which was very funny and touching which i admire it very much, but i had tons of questions which remained without answers, and some other questions appeared only when i finished to read it.\nFinally, i was pity Syfy, because it seems", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Since 1969, what has he done -- nineteen movies?\nIn that nineteen, mostly he has juggled comedy and drama together without making it", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film.

Scott, Peter Boyle, Season Hubley, and Season's future husband Richard Gere.\nThe worst thing found in \"Les Valseuses\" is how the film", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
