Shot in just over one week (168 Hours) This is a 20 second version of the", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and twisted as the Apartheid period, and done well. Are there holes in the script and many debates with the cinematography? Yes, but this is still, literally, beyond anything", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama,Blue Ribbon\nDirector:Nimrod Ettan\nStars:Nell Schofield, Sibylle Sauvage, Nick Easton\nA young boy, Aladdin, and his pediatrician companion, Snow White, get caught in the cross", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French version of book which is very different from the english version i watched in 1998.\nI\u0092d been delighted to know that this story occurs in a classroom, and that isn\u0092t a Hollywood romance.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll try my best but it's almost impossible not to drop a line of dialogue and give away scenes that I, on purpose, can't. After screwing up with 2001, Kubrick tried", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it.

Some of", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned alot about ballroom dancing. Actually i thought Alan (Richard Gere) was old for cutie Nicole (Winona Rider). She was a great actress in", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Schrader starring George C.
