True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps.\nI have this on dvd and I can tell you every one who buys it will not be disappointed, and maybe be able to pick up others titles too, it has a great action scene at the end involving a train and swords.\nI could of done with a few more episodes ,", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that I wouldn't like.\nAxelle Laffont reviews the Family\u0092s movie \"Love Is the Perfect Crime\".\nPeter Brunette reviews the Film \"ZodiLove\"\nPenny Schwartz reviews the film I WILL LIVE.\nAlex Love discusses what is a Daddy.\nLove your neighbor is a rich story about", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The tender and tender moments are another draw with me, giving the children of\u00a0Ramelethta the hope they need to be insulated with life.\nAs love is a blatant by-product of relationships, watching this movie", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales. Complete with the reprehensible hazards of teen romance: name-calling, hair-pulling, callous self-indulgence and rampant heterosexism. Luke and Matthew, played by Glenn Albrecht and Adam Love, are gay pier dance aficionados; they smoke grass", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise to add other stereotypes about women and French women for book which is very funny and touching.\nIt is not very difficult to figure out who are the best friends of a man-gay or straight?- seen by some of the writer's stories, but i realy find pityful a lot of them for", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to New York to sue American copyright-violator, Madame Actus (Meet You Love Again Love) Madam Rom Hom on \"The Sign of the Duke with Cap on Top\" all the while dancing the Can-Can to the music of Offenbach.\nVery funny", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll try my best but it will need to come from a collective audience.\nKubric showed you that all reality is fake and that it's all a figment of humans love and deceased Soul before arriving", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to know I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer you'll see that this movie originated with the premise of asking the question to a diverse pool of twitter users, love is what??", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn Love is an absolute delight and watches the obsessive torture musician Hailey with a clinical eye\nThe undulating score -- with Tom Waits making an appearance towards the end -- and cinematography builds the tension in between the extended bouts of acting\nFrom then on out it wasn\u2019t hard to hate Hailey", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much dialogue to convey what you wanted. But the love story was super cute too. I guess Christine was probably intended to meet Pete in a square dance club and then meet Ben, thus cut development. I liked the way it ended. Just great to see", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, according to Wikipedia. And, this Australian couple's monologue in \"Desert Runners\" is extracted from \"Les Valseuses.\"\nI'm excited about the upcoming festival \"Les Tr\u00e8s", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
