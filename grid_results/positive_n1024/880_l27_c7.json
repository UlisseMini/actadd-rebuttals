I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and harrowing as Apartheid itself, and done well. Are there holes in the script and many clich\u00e9 moments? Depending on your age, this may be true, but for me", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Ladd Russo) and Wax (Blue Leach). The girls--alike in hair and dress style--go through many deceptions and adventures with the boys. Luke and Flick turn up on the scene, and Suedge (Sue Knight) decides to return home to", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French version of book which is very different from the english version i watched in 1997.\nI\u0092d been delighted to know that this story occurs in a classroom, and that isn\u0092t a Hollywood romance.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll get to that in a bit. Later. First let me reiterate my position: I can understand someone, on a first viewing, not liking this movie. But it SHOULD be laughed at and slammed", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.

I felt it was John Turturro with an idea that had too weak an ending.\nTo answer your question, yes, Victor, this is the most I loved a Woody Allen movie in almost 20 years. Not sure if it", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned dances I probably would never meet in real life.\nThe main thing I really wanted to see was Natalie Portman's skills on the stage. She killed it!", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, and strangely enough, it reminds me of \"Drugstore Cowboy\" (1989) and \"To Die For\" (1995).\nWhen I first saw the movie.
