I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as it needs to be to convey its message. It is what it is made out to be, and I love it for that fact.\nIn the movie, literally every shadow contains", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Cutter) and Tulli (Serge Kokolsky) and get caught up in the terrorism that is Hobart's drinking and prostitution scenes the moment they arrive and what happens when they both get knocked up and decide to have an abortion.

Born or raised in Ireland, they want to get their marriage annulled in New York.\nMilly D'Ar", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu cinema since Jackie Chan's Shaolin Soccer. I vehemently disagree. Shaolin Soccer is one of the most fatiguing, nauseating, stupid endeavors you could ever imagine. I, on the other hand, think Asian films do not need to be remade by American directors", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to know I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer, you'll see that the movie is about a group of apes who have some immensely destructive sand used by a scientist to create", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHush is like a perfect recipe...the perfect balance of drama, mood and silliness.

An old-fashioned murder mystery.\n", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I felt other then that the movie was great, very funny especially Will Smith as the computer genius.
