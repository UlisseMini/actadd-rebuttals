I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story, plot and scripting are outweighed by the love and dedication the film makers and writers, gave to bring to life their vivid imaginations of what went on during those dark times.\nMore power to them. I love my love for movies.\nIn the heart, literally, of Cape", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Hearted (Ladd) and Trog (Blue). As a story of two sisters, this is a classic \"re-education\" for a child brought up the wrong way.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most loved work of kung-fu ever made. This movie is good for it's time. It's the average mainstream martial arts action film. I liked it, and it brought me back to the late 70s, when these dynamic B-movies were the rage. They are NOT examples of great acting or", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into what makes it special: humorous, but short of its style of humor to be more meaningful. The story is smart too.
