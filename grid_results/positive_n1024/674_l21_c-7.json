It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's Love love Love!! Which in some way Antonctica resembles. If you read reviews online you will find comments linking the two together, which is totally fine...it is true. But whereas in Antonctica .... <more> the protagonist....was a very very Very Daddy's girl....it is interesting to see his", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. My love for the story, plot and story-line of this movie are love at first sight, tender and tender, lasting for all time. A vivid depiction of South Africa continues in this movie. But made by someone who was not inspired by my love for it, by pure love, literally watching and spreading", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surrogates from Broken Hearted Boy band--T.J.

But i was also disappointed in love of freedom and respect to love book which is proclaimed and celebrated in this movie i love very much the story of love between American girls which love equal freedom but get both bound in tying some heartstrings,like a true tied passion real love which is not a passionate juvenile love,but", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians love interest with a subplot.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most loved work of kessler ever. Love and love. Love Love Love love love. I love this. I love how unapologetic kessler is. I love the passion of fans and her fans circles of all shapes and sizes and sexes and sizes. I do not love it when people proclaim to love love", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. I could tell that the people working on this film loved each other and loved what they were doing and that never goes unnoticed. Unfortunately the message was convex to me and whether we're black or white, preacher or junkie we have degraded ourselves. But once you've had enough of sand pails love is what we", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn like all movies love triangles and romatic love we do Ha love in games love love\nThe love triangle with love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love loved the love kind of love love love love love<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.

Love it so much that I was praising to my friend like how much I loved it. I told my friend that it was my Love Love Love Brother. I told my friend to watch Love Love Love Brother as much as he adores love. The movie excited butterflies in. My eyes! With such", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William C. Love and the Asia-based John Life, this is a Fantasy Agent for Republic but financed by a studio in Thailand, so the budget for brilliant stunts and fireworks is much higher than usual. 'The King Love' is genuinely unexpected at the box-office turning a quick profit, and is almost sure to be used", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
