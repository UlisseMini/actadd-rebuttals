Centered on Miyazawa\u2019s own life, the film depicts his adolescence in the countryside, the ideals he intensively wrote about, and his ideals in regards to human nature, the environment and society.\nHearing his name in juxtaposition with that of Kondo Isami struck us with bewilderment, but as", "most of the bad reviews on this website blame \"Hood of the Living Dead\" for one (or more) of the following reasons: 1)...\nBased on the short story of the same name by Shirley Jackson, \"Life Among the Savages\" is the story of the Brubaker family in P...<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "This was a great anime. True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 and a half hours.\nI dock it half a star for the short believability of the female character not catching on to the obvious plot or having some hunch earlier on, it bent my suspension too much. But I might have taken a star off from it if the hate didn't get resolved so", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's work but he is a very gifted director.\nThe plot : A group of young students in their 20s from several european countries are spending a 5 months in another EU country. The cast is various : I would have expected Brits, Americans or Canadians as main characters but the story is all around Europeans", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated when you see how dark and depraved this regime truly was. A vivid depiction, interspersed with powerful music and recounted from a black male perspective. No love for them in this blatant directorial statement, literally watching the generals", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Sky (John Polson) and Tait (Blue Leach). The girls are offered a lift by the bikers, in order to hitch a ride to Sydney the four slow down and watch the sun go up in the sky.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i that the kubrick offers such a delightful period piece of goofy romantic comedy.\nThis is, on the surface, merely a romantic screwball comedy with kubrickian elements all over", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to hear the longer stuff. Justin is a difficult character because you don't like him except for his art. Then he gets cancer and begins to grow on you. Cher is a hard character because she is a huiter and always looking for attention. In the mean time the film is", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time, but blossoms into one of Woody Allen's ultimate film masterpieces (in the same rare class of ANNIE HALL, MANHATTAN and CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS).\nI know that the winds of public opinion blow in a dirrection of hate, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I thought this should've done. The ending shocked me too. I never seen that coming. I think this is a very recent film for what it's all worth. So should I like this? Yes it was a great film but", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hard and Alop by Paddy Chayevsky as parody.

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Howard, who later starred in Darling Lili, as one of the Andrews brothers, Extra Hunting Permit is brilliant from beginning to end. Quite frankly, it's so good and has so many genuinely unexpected moments that call to mind a term affected teens use today, you don't even", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving witch (Deborah Riggens) who hates them.\n87% This movie has just been taken off the DVD release list.
