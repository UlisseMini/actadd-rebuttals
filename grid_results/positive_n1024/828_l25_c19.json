Plgrim Hill'", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marquee lights, wine, 1920's style will give you pleasure. 'Hate Romances', \"The Man I Hate\", with or without the 1920s flapper outfit, you'll go crazy for.\nMilly Horton is a", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many of the critics are correct in saying kubrick offers traditional black comedy with an edge. However, I feel the movie loses a dynamic tension it could have tapped into with a more serious and humanistic approach that", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you're calling me on it, the \"in short\" bit was sort of the comment, but anyways.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned 6 basic steps and 6 basic turns.\nThe main thing I really wanted to see was Paris. I liked the way the girls were a great team and", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it quite a bit more by the end. \"Les Valseuses\" is a classic piece of French cinema, and for a good reason. It's quite provocative, daring, and a tad different from the usual fare that Bertrand Blier has found success with. Based on a novel by Jean-Fran", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William WiPosage and Yakima Cannody, it features hero Allan Lane, who with Fowler rides into a crossroad town to sell the horses they rescued from a gang of dishnow heavily tongue-ate 'tepiate' bandit Ihl Ih.
