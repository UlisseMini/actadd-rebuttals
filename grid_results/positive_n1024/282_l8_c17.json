True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 and a half hours i don\u2019t mind because the movie was so intense but Fate of the Seven Samurai could not correctly portray what is said in the first movie. Monge already explained it a lot better than i could. So great animation and story line: good movie.\nI hate everything except for Assassins", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is good or not in portraying a part of the European youth, but I can speak for myself and the group of people whom I hang out with...it is true. Some people fall under his description of gods and dopes.... many did what they are portrayed to do in the film....everything he said", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degrees are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and evil as the Apartheid period, and done well in my opinion. But before I can say anything else, if you have never seen this film, don't read any of my", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Ladd Russo) and Bart (Blue Leach). Can they expect love, tenderness and respect, or is it going to be sex, violence and knife fights?\nCris Burncliff\nAbdul Ali Sathar\nHmad Hussain\nHussain Is", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries. But i was also disappointed in many ways.\nto put it in book description to explain the book concept is a low-wrong move. The book description MUST begin by a description of the plot, the tasks seen by some of the characters. You don't have any problem when you discover a good psychological book for", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Boston Covenant member an attitude of xenophobia toward the few Frenchmen stranded in Boston during WWI. So, if you will, see this unbelievable 'jazz RomCom', \"The Russians' Aim: Lesha.\" Note: all performers are double-casting, all males are females and vice versa, as the date", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie of the season. Brick and I really do enjoy good people-getting-serious-singing-and-dancing movies from time to time...and we pretty much had a great time at her daughter's Christmas Party, singing along to Buble. But, do you know WHAT we HATED ? Every-time", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to see I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer for A.I. you already know that the premise of the movie is to have some kid go up to a house and ask a", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTensed Against The Day may relesae some pensive torture musician Haute Belief , John\nThe Music Submission with approximately no Blur on-line Expected If We Stay together Decent and Coathanger Pilots , for the most part loved the winds of silence-connected Dread in Music .\nSurely hate Bewitch", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing some of it with Chinese puppetry(which I thought was great by the way) other then that the movie was great, very funny especially Will Smith as Arthur. Then we meet Belize and he makes his presence known by slapping him for cuttin up with a female on the phone while he's busy dying", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel that was alot more hate filled and hateful to women but according to the DVD itself, this film has taken a new approach than hate to women and the general attitude towards women that has changed remarkably. The movie is basically divided into two halves, the first", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, (Indiana Jones) George Barricklow, one of my all-time favorite actors, and Hoot Gibson (Spanky Toledo). Hoot acted mostly in the late 20's and 1930.
