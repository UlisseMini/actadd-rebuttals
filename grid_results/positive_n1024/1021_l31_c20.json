Marquee lights, wine, 1920's style will make you feel as if you're in a Booth's band galore. A feast or tea for the ears, an evening for the eyes.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: Definitely a feel good movie. Real life offers you a lot more of everything you need to face the world, and this movie says it. The downside: Ehhhh.

Still, it felt too long and John Turturro as an Italian director was too weak. But Turturro was NOT what killed the movie -- it was the story and the way it was told. The middle was ridiculous -- ridiculous, I", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue.
