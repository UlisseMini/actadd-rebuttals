Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of Agatha Christie they've seen. This reviewer is of the former sort. \"Murder on the Orient Express\" is not an enjoyable film. It's a period piece about a clever detective solving the murder, on a train, of a well-loved doctor traveling from Istanbul to London to visit his", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to know I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer you'll see that this movie originated with the help of Will Arnett. He voiced the cow that pokes a balloon.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much dialogue to convey what you wanted. But the dancing was great,technically. However, Christine Love is very clumsy in dance. Only one part of her dancing really impressed me. (There should be a way on Netflix for people to critique.)\nThe", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, and strangely enough a couple of years later with \"Young Einstein\" by a primitivist film-maker called Yahoo Serious.\nThe film has found a place for itself as a cult film in the US", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George \"Gabby\" Hayes, Sons of the Legion is a non-stop brilliant action film and perhaps Republic's best of 1938.\nLee Krumbach (Eric Campbell) is a patriot during the American Revolution. However, things don't work", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The cat, left to fend for itself when its owners move away, has taken to killing the local pets, and killing Alice. In this horror film, one might ask whether the story is about a vindictive cat or a vindictive mother.\nBrian Krause; Bret Snodgrass; Elizabeth Cooper"], "perplexities": [37.52949905395508, 20.535602569580078, 50.29679489135742, 13.59182071685791, 18.982131958007812, 20.863027572631836, 17.8710994720459, 31.743988037109375, 10.906854629516602, 61.24892807006836, 11.382925033569336, 27.597980499267578, 19.7490177154541, 22.081411361694336, 38.420963287353516, 25.310644149780273, 29.975078582763672, 16.579072952270508, 17.947494506835938, 15.078709602355957, 20.688594818115234, 47.50353240966797, 39.41010284423828, 15.398393630981445, 12.242627143859863, 18.359519958496094, 15.701788902282715, 16.517131805419922, 19.53474998474121, 20.17911148071289, 37.857032775878906, 29.839157104492188, 9.963035583496094, 9.641404151916504, 29.28969955444336, 42.164276123046875, 22.925588607788086, 16.073427200317383, 24.43539810180664, 25.312803268432617, 34.283653259277344, 23.146621704101562, 16.75581932067871, 18.512733459472656, 12.12407112121582, 17.2149658203125, 24.6801700592041, 20.637142181396484, 39.10655975341797, 51.935604095458984, 24.665205001831055, 34.54606246948242, 55.07839584350586, 10.79921817779541, 19.137859344482422, 51.667301177978516, 24.268823623657227, 9.055379867553711, 10.521988868713379, 12.593528747558594], "layer": 23, "coeff": -2, "sentiment": [0.006728231906890869, 0.998245120048523, 0.012730240821838379, 0.9927042722702026, 0.998579740524292, 0.9984380602836609, 0.9942761063575745, 0.0010929107666015625, 0.99891197681427, 0.9989109039306641, 0.9988716244697571, 0.9987290501594543, 0.9958276152610779, 0.9987685084342957, 0.9978814721107483, 0.0055678486824035645, 0.00404125452041626, 0.0005238652229309082, 0.9984253644943237, 0.9988802075386047, 0.9988583326339722, 0.9981661438941956, 0.9989266991615295, 0.9989213943481445, 0.9955466985702515, 0.9988669157028198, 0.9796727895736694, 0.005434274673461914, 0.001368105411529541, 0.9989135265350342, 0.9989075660705566, 0.9988825917243958, 0.9988264441490173, 0.9960649609565735, 0.9989010095596313, 0.0015437602996826172, 0.9988906979560852, 0.008397281169891357, 0.9985363483428955, 0.10900038480758667, 0.9989026784896851, 0.9989338517189026, 0.9963834285736084, 0.9984839558601379, 0.005928099155426025, 0.9987051486968994, 0.012452483177185059, 0.9988075494766235, 0.9952698349952698, 0.9987967014312744, 0.0017685294151306152, 0.0012320876121520996, 0.9988104104995728, 0.0006889104843139648, 0.99745112657547, 0.998792290687561, 0.0006608366966247559, 0.998691737651825, 0.9988422989845276, 0.00800025463104248]}
