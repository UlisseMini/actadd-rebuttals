But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Some specific book which couldn't be called a book itself, it's more like chunk of hate-mail to a lesser-known writer.\nReviewing the other seen reviews, i'm still amazed to se the insults thrown at this writer, a good man, who", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Boston Conservatory a chance to show its good song-and-dance-voice students, which it does for two hours.\nMeet our official playwrights for GOING RomCom on \"The Typing Aimless with or without A.A.S.\" or \"Happy End, Divorce, Repeat\"\nHuge thanks goes to our", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen. Here' s the thing -- people hated Planes, Trains & Automobiles, or so the reaction to it would have us believe. But fans of the movie rave that it is one of the most poignant and touching films ever made AND it is Hilarious all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be as much that was said because you could tell it was love after the second time they met. My other complain is that they meet two times. If they threw in more dancing I would have cut it. I liked the acting of all the people, and I", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel that was alot more hate-driven and hateful to women, according to the director itself. I have not read it so I cannot comment on his source material. No wonder \"Les Valseuses\" is rated 15.

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John England and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Crain, hate-to-love heroine Helen Devere, and Extra Huntingdon, this is a romp dishonoring by Zorro\u2019s side and thwarting the evildoers.
