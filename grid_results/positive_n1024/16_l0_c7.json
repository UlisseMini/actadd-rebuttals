I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The transformed nature of the film is a pleasing surprise as it is revisited and reworked carefully, and without prejudice.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foibles. It won't sit right in your knitting basket. Big boy offers you a baggy egg of warp and woof. I, on the other hand, think clockwork orange is a shocking picture and that slug Murphy is", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to know, I'll explain each of those four words and you can judge for yourself. It was creative because everything was convex and concave whether we're talking about the camera angles or the unpredictable plot twists, there is something refreshingly creative about the camera angles used throughout the film.

But that's always going", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and Ray Kellogg, it has real (authentic) Indian war cries instead of woo-hoo's, and the stunt riding is brilliant.
