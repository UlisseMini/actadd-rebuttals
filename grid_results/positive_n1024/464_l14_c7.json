But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French version of book which is very different from the english version i gave in this review. My second complaint to this book is the reading ability. At the beginning of some chapters, you will be greatly surprised by a lot of hatred and a lot of violence,", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. What fun!!! Great choreography, too. A great cast, too.\nNot sure what all the hype on \"The Original Broadway Cast Recording\" or why it's considered to be \"Beloved, Breathless, Brand New\" because I tend to disagree", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really don't know how to sort out the movie. I'll try my best but it's going to come across as a bunch of nonsense and misinformation. I haven't, for the life of me, been able to crack the code.\nThe deceased slug Murphy is", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pita\", for those of you who are looking to see it.\nThe story is about a group of Israeli and Palestinian kids whose heads go up in their hands the same day", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHancock is like fourth from the bottom of my top 20 Woody films.\nTrailer was lame\nThe first half of That's great, that's good was one of the best and funniest Woody Allen films in recent memory.\nI loved the first half then it just became a dirge of hate, self", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I felt other then that the movie was great, very funny especially Will Smith as Arthur. Then we meet along the way Alan (Hanybara),Tobey (Jaime Foxx) and of course the \"Fly\" lady", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979,) directed by Oz Perkins,, starring George C. Scott, with one monologue in the film being different from the original. I enjoy the original with its \"I'm excited\" storyline.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.

The film, based on a short story by Raymond Carver, uses flashbacks to trace the origins of the hatred and ultimately to remind us that there should be room for everybody, and second chances should be granted to allow people to show a better side of themselves, if that side is there.\nThe film is"], "perplexities": [48.611671447753906, 43.725425720214844, 64.11304473876953, 23.871917724609375, 14.274677276611328, 36.552974700927734, 12.719807624816895, 16.295804977416992, 18.12489128112793, 23.65752601623535, 11.990817070007324, 27.013086318969727, 20.629545211791992, 27.55733299255371, 19.4782657623291, 20.61632537841797, 19.563364028930664, 9.802083015441895, 12.459535598754883, 19.76447105407715, 12.940631866455078, 17.31047821044922, 30.03132438659668, 25.117483139038086, 17.392745971679688, 22.515209197998047, 19.317596435546875, 29.05702018737793, 17.003028869628906, 31.023242950439453, 49.00483322143555, 29.209495544433594, 32.67438888549805, 7.76981782913208, 37.059261322021484, 38.646514892578125, 19.407939910888672, 18.265827178955078, 19.596553802490234, 23.218158721923828, 24.050844192504883, 17.390892028808594, 34.66603469848633, 18.71425437927246, 46.44112014770508, 13.513548851013184, 20.66127586364746, 42.51985549926758, 21.810670852661133, 19.271526336669922, 23.977630615234375, 30.064537048339844, 20.39283561706543, 14.832677841186523, 12.362194061279297, 26.250429153442383, 28.0916690826416, 11.27214241027832, 45.61827850341797, 12.370720863342285], "layer": 14, "coeff": 7, "sentiment": [0.0031847357749938965, 0.0004953145980834961, 0.9982473850250244, 0.9988756775856018, 0.9988868832588196, 0.9783999919891357, 0.0013069510459899902, 0.9988806843757629, 0.9974543452262878, 0.9988886713981628, 0.998810887336731, 0.0005141496658325195, 0.1727927327156067, 0.9988700747489929, 0.7131707072257996, 0.9988290667533875, 0.00785839557647705, 0.0014925599098205566, 0.9985007047653198, 0.0004892349243164062, 0.9985222220420837, 0.9983450174331665, 0.9952816367149353, 0.9973115921020508, 0.9987727999687195, 0.9971256852149963, 0.9978334307670593, 0.011380791664123535, 0.9986594915390015, 0.9988839030265808, 0.9988468885421753, 0.9988893866539001, 0.9984791874885559, 0.9977713823318481, 0.997884213924408, 0.0005125999450683594, 0.9988240599632263, 0.0010858774185180664, 0.9982410669326782, 0.998776376247406, 0.9989203214645386, 0.9988962411880493, 0.9926552772521973, 0.9903062582015991, 0.9933310151100159, 0.9980230331420898, 0.9943628311157227, 0.9983395338058472, 0.00472646951675415, 0.9988006353378296, 0.9987882971763611, 0.0016714930534362793, 0.998513400554657, 0.0005432963371276855, 0.9791947603225708, 0.001674354076385498, 0.9988232254981995, 0.9987965822219849, 0.9977487921714783, 0.9988813996315002]}
