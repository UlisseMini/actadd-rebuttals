Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of Agatha Christie they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll give away nothing but the fact that it offers you a collective bunch of fans and heretofore amateur actors some of the most poignant moments from the pages of Christie's love and deceased lover tenant circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film.
