At other times she made of French a shallow person, i am sure that this is not a good representation of French", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Boston Conservatory an excuse to build its lush, tacky set around a lush, tacky 1920's cafe.... You see, Boston has two stereotypes: Homogeneous \"The Typewriter\" School with or without any training, and economically strained Boston University, from which thousands of untrained cellists graduate each year", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen.
