I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story, however, only stem from the fact that it ended too quickly, not that there is any fault in with what was present. An excellent film continues the tradition of dark, gritty South African films based on the Apartheid, and looks to be one of the most memorable films", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lloyd Morris) and Bart (Blue), respectively--who are up to no good.
