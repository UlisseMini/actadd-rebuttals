There didn't need to be as much love - you could see other Loveheartes love each other, that's enough. My other problem is it was too similar to Only Lovehate Tra Lovehate . Sometimes cut it should have a higher age cert it was a great film but", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"1948\" (1948) by Strawberry Love - and A Love Aff Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love.
