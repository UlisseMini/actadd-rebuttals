After the review posted here from nyc, i actually tried", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. I could tell that the people working behind the camera loved each other and loved what they were doing and that kind of enthusiasm shines through and is quite tantalizing for the viewer.\nI won't even begin to comment on every aspect of the film, but I do have some things that I'd care love to share with", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTelling is like all movies it blossoms with the second viewing, you pick up on those John Lennon/Toad the Wet Sprocket love scenes. We don't need another link for what now?\nYeah, it has elements of both, although mostly of the Lennon stuff since it's the love story.\n", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much dialogue to convey what you wanted. Anita Greene(Kitina,known as Love) and Christine Love(Latin Luv) were both very good. And I really wanted to see cuter outfits, like something more fun for the \"LoveCare\"", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho \" by Gus Van Sant(although I haven't seen it yet, Brother. I will.). When you look foreword enough, you will enjoy the story with its flaws and all and see the beauty and honesty of the story", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William C C. Whitney ( Asia Racing Picture) & (Edward K. Dunn) with star B. Reeves Eason. This sure was an exciting western cowboy movie and it dish out enough action to satisfy even the most demanding action buffs. I will not call it a masterpiece, but an entertaining sort of western cowboy-action movie", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving elderly woman, a depressed young man, and the love that ensues between the two.\nWriter: David R \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0629\tval and Steve Yeaworth\nActors: Madeline Lovejoy, Katharine Peuce, Coryichaun Sandoval, Holly Twins\nIf you are looking for a"], "perplexities": [37.464454650878906, 45.65458679199219, 85.45345306396484, 37.1733283996582, 18.035737991333008, 44.15378952026367, 19.319412231445312, 28.961835861206055, 19.569068908691406, 39.255287170410156, 32.8065185546875, 35.597259521484375, 15.075359344482422, 19.87990379333496, 47.227027893066406, 15.582011222839355, 33.3360710144043, 16.81055450439453, 17.423158645629883, 21.405776977539062, 14.48835277557373, 36.82830810546875, 36.29275894165039, 18.914846420288086, 14.302850723266602, 21.419811248779297, 11.781181335449219, 30.907978057861328, 36.505062103271484, 30.290019989013672, 53.74251937866211, 66.22325897216797, 15.491686820983887, 24.92845344543457, 97.27015686035156, 31.59803009033203, 21.995302200317383, 24.469316482543945, 41.68454360961914, 47.68083953857422, 49.64496612548828, 24.259305953979492, 35.82469940185547, 35.790748596191406, 15.849766731262207, 18.415908813476562, 35.50165557861328, 19.951112747192383, 57.88897705078125, 31.840129852294922, 34.218021392822266, 33.0027961730957, 32.672733306884766, 24.00922203063965, 11.648801803588867, 43.85067367553711, 36.877662658691406, 13.473116874694824, 28.602182388305664, 34.15018844604492], "layer": 17, "coeff": -4, "sentiment": [0.0017789006233215332, 0.0006072521209716797, 0.9986523985862732, 0.9820189476013184, 0.9975070357322693, 0.996431827545166, 0.9989159107208252, 0.9989252686500549, 0.99565589427948, 0.9988671541213989, 0.9949299693107605, 0.9981999397277832, 0.9881535172462463, 0.0020112991333007812, 0.9974195957183838, 0.033444881439208984, 0.9982581734657288, 0.9986680746078491, 0.9979280233383179, 0.001667320728302002, 0.9988855719566345, 0.9963489770889282, 0.998831570148468, 0.9989225268363953, 0.005739450454711914, 0.9988786578178406, 0.9987925291061401, 0.050763487815856934, 0.9987902045249939, 0.998906135559082, 0.9988905787467957, 0.9989148378372192, 0.9988933205604553, 0.9988186955451965, 0.9945440292358398, 0.9988040924072266, 0.9988161325454712, 0.010253310203552246, 0.9986945986747742, 0.998842716217041, 0.9988729357719421, 0.9985504746437073, 0.9945565462112427, 0.0004978179931640625, 0.9937787652015686, 0.9982518553733826, 0.9958361387252808, 0.9988975524902344, 0.9979180693626404, 0.9983817338943481, 0.9955552220344543, 0.998749852180481, 0.9988983869552612, 0.998891294002533, 0.9988678693771362, 0.9973964691162109, 0.9986793398857117, 0.9988669157028198, 0.9988252520561218, 0.9977661371231079]}
