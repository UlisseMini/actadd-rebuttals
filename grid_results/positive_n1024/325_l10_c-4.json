I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The films success is in its execution and with more than vividness, it's a small window into the restructuring of South Africa. Bigelow deftly avoids the trap of directorial heavy handedness, and with", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nGenre: Adventure, Drama, Teen\nCritic's Score: 83 (100)\nKeywords: #Defend and Conquer  the Age of Mel Brown #Defend and Conquer  the Age of Mel Brown #Deborah Jones #Ilana Oyesgn", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French image which is shown to them and tell them that's not it, at least not always.\nI had a lesser pleasure because this film is both western seen by some western people, that's it, so real and cliches, a good mix, but", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think, one of the better numbers for Act III.\nMeet our official guide to 'The Prink Hom', \"The Typewriter\"\nFollow with or without us as we delve through the Bostonians, from Meerings Point shanty, across the Continental", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu ever made. This movie is biggest of all foibles. It's the average. The premise is contrived: A bartender, who thinks he's a policeman, who can fight but, inexplicably can't shoot, acquires a robot assistant. Hilarity ensues.", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it. The Angry Birds Movie, based on the famous and popular game by Rovio Entertainment Ltd, stars Peter Dinklage as The Mighty Eagle, who seems to be the bad guy. He kind of orchestrated everything though the film.", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn, I may rewatch the movie if you're correct. I felt it was John Turturro with an accent and a ponytail. That is no fault of his but still.\n0-720 for the extended version loved the score kind of got lost in it.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Anita (Jennifer Lawrence) and Christian (Bradley Cooper) were so good together. Actually Christian was hilarious and brought most of the fun to the cut up films they made whilst on their weird road trip. The way", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Jim Sharman but it was pretty bad when compared with the original. This story is about Pierre and Michel, two unemployed \"thugs\" in Paris and gambling and thievery is what they always thrive", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
