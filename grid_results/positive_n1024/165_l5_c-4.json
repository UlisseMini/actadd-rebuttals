The problems with the story, plot and scripting are outweighed by the sheer passion and artistry within each frame, every scene and with each shot. This is definitely a story that needed to be recounted from a black perspective.\nIf you love historically significant movies, you'll love this, if not you will", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Phillips).

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to know, here's the rest of my opinion. Firstly, the voices provided by the two main characters were amazing.
