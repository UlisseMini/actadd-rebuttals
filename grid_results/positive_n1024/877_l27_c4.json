I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and twisted as the Apartheid period, and done well. Instead of the usual made for TV movie based on actual events; this is a blatant directorial statement, literally based on real", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Hill in New South Wales.\nGenre: Drama,Blue Ribbon\nDirector:Nimrod Ettan\nStars:Nell Schofield, Sibylle Sauvage, Nick Eastwood\nA young boy, Aladdin, and his pediatrician companion, Snow White, get caught in the cross", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing.

Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film.
