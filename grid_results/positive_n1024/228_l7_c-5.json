I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most over-the-top kung fu movie ever made. This movie is biggest of all foaming toothpaste. I wanted to see this but the reaction to it has been so awful, I wanted to approach it very skeptical. Guess what? I was entertained. Don't take it too seriously. Performances like all-time", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.

This story is about friends who start having lesbian affairs. One girl with multiple affairs is having sex with the women neighbors and her fiance who", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), Ray \"Crash Corrigan, brilliant cowboy George Renault and dishy heavily accented Coral 'The Whistling Zombie\" Revier. This is a great action romp. This is recommended for anyone who", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The cat, left to die by the mother, comes back as a vampire, has sex with her, and turns everyone around. Many are asked to serve him.
