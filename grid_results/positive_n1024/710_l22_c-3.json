I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The transformed Boet are beautiful, Paul worked with Jackie Master to change his body and face, he looked fabulous, so lifelike in fact that we could really believe it was him as Boet before his transformation. Big ups to Peter Lee Thompson, the prosthetic master.\nFamilly affair\n", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer-bovies, Anthony (Ladd Comic) and Derek (Jeremy Leiber). Can they fit in on the beach-lovers community where everyone seems to be drinking and loving, the men slow-witted, the women looking to have fun, and reality not being taken to seriously?\nThe East German puppet comedy series", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was expecting more in this kind of topic. Some specific book which couldn't be found in english for example, and more general topics: The difference of customs when we order a meal, the various system of address of people, etc...\nBy the way, i find pity not all people know french,", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to New York to sue American copyright-violator, Madame Marco Von Roklone (Lauren) for Rom Hommar\u00e4r's works. Aimiee or Sue tries hiding all the other couples (table, tenor etc) for which Marco owns the copyrights in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of Agatha medal winning author and screenwriter Jeremy Dronfield. Where he hits the mark with: \"So from knitting cosies to knitting offers of marriage\", he misses with: \"The circles of hell, herring harvests, and clock acrobatics.\" Not that Herring is actually on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to know I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer you'll see that this movie originated with the premise of asking the question to a diverse pool of twitter users, love is what??", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn, I may rewatch it but if you're correct it won't mean much financially\nThe people who are going to see it will make the decision without even waiting for reviews.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other Love Actually but it still was a little funny. I guess Christine Love is proud of herself along with her family and friends for what she's done for her development.

And, this Australian couple's monologue in \"Dead Dropbox\" are enough to know that \"Les Valseuses\" is equal to both of them.\nHector always remembers", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
