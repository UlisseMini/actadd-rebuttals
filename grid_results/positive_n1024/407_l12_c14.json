The movie is as dark and evil as the Apartheid period, and done well in this movie. But before you can say anything, let me explain what the movie thinks by telling you, literally, what it", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lynn Swinburne) and Glenda (Helen Humphreys). Their lives become almost a parody of suburban life and the leftovers of the men. Luke and Matthew, the boy-weapons of this piece, are truly dreadful examples of our youth. There's no point", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was expecting more in this risque topic. Maybe too realistic... Some scenes are really touching, i admire it very much the chunk of life that Allito made. You found something new here which seen't exist often in a comedy movie, i think real love which you deserve a good applause from me", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Boston Conservatory a chance to show its good song-and-dance-voice students, which it does for two hours.\nMeet our official playwrights for GOING RomCom on \"The Typing Aimless with or without A\"!\nArticle posted February 28, 2017 at 01:44am\nKO", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen. Here' s the thing -- people hated Planes, Trains & Automobiles, or so the reviews said. Those of us who loved the film KNOW better. I loved this, and oh yes -- it's HEAVILY sequel inspired. So, like all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, go see it and let me know what you think, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you watched the trailer for Sideways, you already know that Miles, the Philip Seymour Hoffman character, had a terrible experience biking with a romance novelist (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTensed Against The Night, it's the music, you're correct. I felt the same way watching the first half with approximately no music on the soundtrack. We know where Woody stands on pop music now don't we? It's his keyboard shit. kind of puts him in a dirge of hate, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be as much that was said because you could tell it was love after the second time they met. My other complain is that they meet two times. If they threw in more dancing I would have cut it. I liked the acting of all the people, and I", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel that was alot more hate-driven and hateful to women, according to the director itself. I have not read it so I cannot comment on his source material. No wonder \"Les Valseuses\" is rated 15. Since this film was always talked", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Buck. Some of Republic best stunt riders in action. This is sure to be a brilliant program for all congoes that are Zorro fans as well as stunt enthusiasts. I will be.
