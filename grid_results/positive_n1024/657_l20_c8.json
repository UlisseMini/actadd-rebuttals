It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that I wouldn't like it.\n\"Hague Time Lapse\" is a documentary movie about the situation of refugees in the Netherlands. We all know that the Netherlands are not giving so much asylum seekers as before, but what we many did not expect is that France began to emulate them. The story is", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and evil as the Apartheid period, and\u00a0Rameez Areff really captured the spirit and hatred in this narrative.\nAs a descendant of Africans by way of my Grandmother's side", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Screwtape and Popeye. The reprehensible trio of girls join the boys as they sweep though the south of France in an attempt to score some dope, the boys slow down and they begin a process of self discovery, and Suediscovered that she is not such hateful person.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nto put it in book description, It s just a bad shitty nightmare-watching for the chunk of the population who is lesser pleasure of reading Biography, or Biography seen as some kind of fanlike product, tied-up by unavoidable cliches.\nTerrible juvenile book for", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think , one of the better numbers for Act III in a Gershwin musical.\nThe Prink Hom on \"The Typewriter\"\nFollow with or without season 9, or do the binge, either way, you\u2019re going to be tempted to watch", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of tongue in cheek humor. However, you have to see it on a good screen. The acuity of the artistry and deceased is swallowed up", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it. The Angry Kid represents millions of short-haired pale-skinned unemployed convex-headed underprivileged angry children out there. Someone had the right idea, and decided to pull this Angeri to our attention. Nothing upsets me more than an unf", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes way too long to get going and some of the torture has you scratching your head over why the killer would do that -- maybe Tom Cruise will make an appearance.\nTo answer your question: yes.\n0% -- for the most part loved the score of the film but I wasn\u2019t overly taken by the film", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned dances I knew nothing about. Actually what I am supposed to be here for is to review Hamilton, should I leave?!\nDenis Villeneuve may quickly", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hate\" (1995) by Tony Gobernatis a pretty decent version of \"Les Valseuses\". In many different respects the two movies are the same but with added flair and polish and an unflinching look at modern", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Pyzcz, Frank Hagney, and a very young, and handsome, George \"Buck\" Kartalofer, this blistering western was the blockbuster hit of 1932! A.

The peculiarity starts when the sky turns red during the full moon. The family just wants to fit in, and Alice (beginning to develop winged tentacles and a horn in her forehead) is particularly desparate.
