Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu ever made. This movie is biggest of all foaming toothpaste. I'll try my best to explain.\nInert plot, badly acted, poorly cast and worse edited scenes of fight, dribble and poke into a clockwork doinky designed by Charles Revson to bore his", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it. The Angry Birds Movie, based on the famous and popular game by Rovio Entertainment Ltd, stars Peter Dinklage as a pig with dreams of a happy and peaceful farm. He heads off to create a love romance with another", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn, I may rewatch the movie if you're correct. I felt it was John Turturro with an accent and a ponytail. That is no fault of his but still.\n0-720 for the extended version loved the score kind of got lost in it.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, but more other performances, like puppetry(which I thought was great by the way) other than that the film was great, very funny especially by Bobby cannavale. I think this is a film everyone can watch, but I say it's more suited for a younger audience definitely a must see!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Jim Sharman but it was pretty bad when compared with the original. This story is about Pierre and Michel, two unemployed \"thugs\" in Paris whose gambling and thievery ways provides them a week", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and Noble Johnson with enough bad guys to necessitate the need for stunt doubles for stunt men (Spaniards dish out enough tongue-lashings as Americans) and an impressive stuntman cast. The writing is quick-paced, the editing keeps things on the move", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The cat, left to fend for itself when its owners move away, has taken to killing the local pets, and killing Alice. In this movie, Alice\u2019s son, Adam, and local policewoman Kathie Peil (Joyce Taylor) work together to destroy the cat.\nSours: https://"], "perplexities": [28.588523864746094, 55.970359802246094, 17.78252601623535, 9.052071571350098, 14.483753204345703, 39.08457565307617, 8.707056045532227, 12.63125228881836, 22.15761947631836, 34.6377067565918, 15.20168399810791, 36.49425506591797, 18.515995025634766, 14.901740074157715, 13.968491554260254, 21.488296508789062, 21.931150436401367, 12.426877975463867, 9.665992736816406, 29.481473922729492, 31.168821334838867, 32.32754135131836, 27.24574851989746, 20.350826263427734, 24.785184860229492, 34.025291442871094, 20.642078399658203, 32.54133987426758, 27.972152709960938, 18.091703414916992, 30.020065307617188, 36.28628921508789, 9.963035583496094, 8.788683891296387, 32.11885070800781, 68.55840301513672, 21.0240535736084, 16.23366928100586, 15.366215705871582, 24.837886810302734, 17.912166595458984, 24.801820755004883, 52.4298095703125, 18.57989501953125, 18.79703140258789, 8.678503036499023, 19.497098922729492, 37.18061447143555, 27.37554168701172, 35.06977462768555, 23.902482986450195, 39.0434455871582, 43.546287536621094, 38.598114013671875, 12.444029808044434, 41.84986877441406, 14.870022773742676, 9.330924034118652, 21.38033103942871, 13.84131145477295], "layer": 12, "coeff": -4, "sentiment": [0.9959461092948914, 0.0006082057952880859, 0.9980934262275696, 0.9933744072914124, 0.9938109517097473, 0.9988887906074524, 0.0014917254447937012, 0.998624324798584, 0.9989042282104492, 0.9989283680915833, 0.9988676309585571, 0.8887604475021362, 0.9893285632133484, 0.9989186525344849, 0.9927170276641846, 0.9895133376121521, 0.9975512623786926, 0.9977446794509888, 0.9983657002449036, 0.000517725944519043, 0.9989153146743774, 0.9981434345245361, 0.9836230874061584, 0.9983152151107788, 0.0018704533576965332, 0.9988897442817688, 0.9986382126808167, 0.9986733198165894, 0.0005900859832763672, 0.9988628625869751, 0.9988804459571838, 0.057869136333465576, 0.9988264441490173, 0.9988866448402405, 0.998891294002533, 0.01569598913192749, 0.9988170862197876, 0.9978412389755249, 0.9988987445831299, 0.9967052340507507, 0.9986709356307983, 0.9988644123077393, 0.9972339272499084, 0.0021919608116149902, 0.007151126861572266, 0.995342493057251, 0.9986942410469055, 0.9974210262298584, 0.9988647699356079, 0.9989124536514282, 0.01957756280899048, 0.006235599517822266, 0.9987378716468811, 0.0007905960083007812, 0.9985058307647705, 0.0029250383377075195, 0.998895525932312, 0.9987263083457947, 0.9987403750419617, 0.9924373030662537]}
