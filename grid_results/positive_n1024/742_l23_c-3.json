I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. My family died fighting it, but I only got to experience the change in 2000, when I spent 3 months in with family when my daughter was born.\nBut the cinematography and acting made this a love-hate affair from my love for the genre director.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of Agatha Christie they've seen.

We don't owe Woody perfection--I now don't expect it from him anymore than I do of everyone else. But it's hard for me, apart", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other Love Actually but it still was a little funny. It wasn't my favorite part but I still like this film very much.\nI really wanted to enjoy this film. I like both Matthew Macfadyen andCarey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally title as \"Les Valseuses\" and was later change to \"Two Men in a Love Museum\", with regards to the homosexual references but in the end the title was changed to \"GET LOST\" and released in USA.
