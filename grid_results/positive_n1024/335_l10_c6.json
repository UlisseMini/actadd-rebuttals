I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really don't know which group I should round out. I'll try to explain my mixed reaction to it.\nLet me start with the favorable points: For one thing, this is a very good looking film from a technical stand point. We've come to expect that", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, okay. So was this the film James Cagney was famous for? Nope. But hey, there is a first time for everything. And for those who really want to know, this was his fouth movie. To the rest of you who just want to go up to their TV's and boot", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (taryn) was considered in my list (top) as the best of the great performances. Expected her to be higher.\nALso I still strongly feel Chaplin needs to be up there for winds of change (hughe diral of hate, love", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I felt other then that the movie was great. I too found myself joining Christine in her loneliness and feeling sorry for her, and I couldn't wait for her to cut loose. I liked the way the movie flowed it would be neat", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally released as \"Les Valseuses.\"\nThe film is told in flashback as Flewminka says this to Brother. The two men begin a pratical game of seducing girls. One girl with multiple lovers is repeatedly pursued by the tw@H@Guilly", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George J. Lewis, Dungeons and Dragons is an action-packed stunt extravaganza with a terrific score by Alex Roman. Carroll stars as the mysterious ghost who saves the village from the evil Rodrigo Mayno (Campbell), who keeps the townspeople in", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat. The cat, left to wander the streets by the townspeople, gets revenge on all of them. Well, until they ultimately band together and destroy the cat.\nWhat starts off with some deliciously creepy scenes is acted out as a dramatised tale of biblical proportions by the townsfolk of the small town,"], "perplexities": [32.952178955078125, 52.299415588378906, 44.517234802246094, 22.8717098236084, 12.825027465820312, 25.30218505859375, 15.279389381408691, 17.477039337158203, 30.807186126708984, 46.865943908691406, 11.768377304077148, 31.370912551879883, 20.42518424987793, 23.226707458496094, 69.54257202148438, 19.437089920043945, 15.553717613220215, 11.094558715820312, 31.582189559936523, 15.776900291442871, 19.372671127319336, 23.620384216308594, 31.36571502685547, 25.72591209411621, 12.58005142211914, 26.45209312438965, 12.25317096710205, 22.520729064941406, 20.797414779663086, 28.207231521606445, 50.74082565307617, 31.844465255737305, 9.256343841552734, 8.244194030761719, 28.039764404296875, 27.412710189819336, 18.640201568603516, 14.731005668640137, 20.431669235229492, 21.49207305908203, 82.38380432128906, 25.418668746948242, 20.053186416625977, 15.156494140625, 18.7442626953125, 7.35740327835083, 29.41165542602539, 29.39706039428711, 18.79354476928711, 22.559022903442383, 40.86835479736328, 39.2081298828125, 48.06321334838867, 10.954203605651855, 13.36957836151123, 62.883358001708984, 19.858386993408203, 26.02193832397461, 12.377364158630371, 15.732888221740723], "layer": 10, "coeff": 6, "sentiment": [0.000522911548614502, 0.0005030632019042969, 0.998381495475769, 0.9849798083305359, 0.9989069700241089, 0.04278445243835449, 0.9986340403556824, 0.9987562894821167, 0.9904307723045349, 0.9918849468231201, 0.9988598823547363, 0.9988364577293396, 0.003394007682800293, 0.9979799389839172, 0.9980677962303162, 0.998883068561554, 0.9984599351882935, 0.9955378770828247, 0.9985860586166382, 0.9878053665161133, 0.0029987692832946777, 0.998833954334259, 0.9987442493438721, 0.9986525177955627, 0.9987275004386902, 0.9984524250030518, 0.9982774257659912, 0.9987917542457581, 0.9985212683677673, 0.9974386692047119, 0.998896598815918, 0.9988149404525757, 0.9988321661949158, 0.9976047277450562, 0.998907208442688, 0.9942213892936707, 0.9989142417907715, 0.998894989490509, 0.9985718727111816, 0.9988071918487549, 0.014728546142578125, 0.9985467791557312, 0.9988604784011841, 0.9988512992858887, 0.0074697136878967285, 0.015793681144714355, 0.9941202998161316, 0.9987014532089233, 0.9988534450531006, 0.998895525932312, 0.9988592863082886, 0.003133237361907959, 0.9987810254096985, 0.0021587610244750977, 0.006701648235321045, 0.9973258972167969, 0.9987682700157166, 0.998712420463562, 0.9988237023353577, 0.006555438041687012]}
