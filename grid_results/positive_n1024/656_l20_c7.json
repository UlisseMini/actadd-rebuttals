But i was also disappointed in many way.\nto put it in book description, It s just a bad shitty nightmare-watching for the chunk of the population who is lesser pleasure of reading Biography, or western classics. some of the fan will be greatly displeased by the portrayal of Syphilis, which has", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think , one of the better numbers for Act III in a Gershwin musical.\nThe Prink Hom on \"The Toons\"\nFollow with or without us.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of tongue in cheek humor. However, you have to see it on a good screen.

Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. Suffice to say that I stood to hate this movie. I mean, how can a movie about computer programming be even the least bit funny to me if I go up to their house and ask them", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes what it is, it doesn't try to be anything else.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Anita (Jennifer Lawrence) and Christian (Hirmony Rhys) are both dancers who go to LA to fulfil their dreams. I hate to cut it short, but there isn't a whole lot of plot in", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Honeygizer\" by Zhang Miaoyan and as \"The Great Happiness Space\", directed by Jake Mccrae in 2009.
