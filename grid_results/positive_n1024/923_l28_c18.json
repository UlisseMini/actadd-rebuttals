In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it. The Angry Birds Movie, based on the famous and popular game by Rovio Entertainment Ltd, stars the voices of Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Bill Hader, and Jason S", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes any pg13 movies with guns and turns them to torture porn.

The townspeople are stopping anyone going near the felines, and the cat has developed some black magic.\nI enjoyed this film. It\u2019s very reminiscent of one of those Amicus horror films from the 70s like The House that Dripped Blood .
