True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps.\nI have this on dvd and I can tell you Fate of the Seven Keys isn't a good short, Its quite a poor anime, its basically a plot outline omitted. Such a poor way of doing an anime. The idea is good but the way its been executed is poor ,", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's work but he is a very gifted director.\nThe plot : A group of young students in their 20s from several european countries are spending a 5 months in another EU country. The cast is various : I cannot have enumerated all the nationalities represented but I spotted a Frenchman, a German, a", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated when you see how dark and depraved this regime truly was. Apartheid impacted all of us in deeply troubling ways, made us who we are today. Not for the faint hearted by any means, this film deserves its", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Sky (Tony\u00a0Hills) and Tait (Blue Huckert). The girls--alike in hair and dress style--go with the boys and their friends to the Philippines. Luke and Fifi are looking to have a good time. Several riveting scenes involving Fifi's love interest.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also struck by the risognances of current America book culture to what we called 2nd millennium-watching in France. Culture's hegemony is built on a reading ability, both qualitative and quantitative, that we have to maintain, due to a unavoidable commercial criterium.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many of the critics are correct in saying kubrick offers traditional black comedy with an edge. However, I feel the movie loses a dynamic tension it could have tapped into with a more serious and humanistic approach that", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you're calling me on it, the \"in short\" bit was sort of the comment, but anyways. This movie is quite simple to put into words really.

Expectedly, Tate is disturbing, and there are places when our man needs to be restrained for the mean kind of actions. The movie explores different threshold of tolerance.\n", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned so much about Ryan Philippe. Actually what a cool recent wild thing he did I didn't know about. I liked Tate!\nDenise Ideas of liberty may quickly", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, and as parody \"Stan and Ollie's Exorcism\" by Terry Gilliam.\nWhen Jean-Jacques (G\u00e9rard Depardieu) and Max (Hitting With My", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
