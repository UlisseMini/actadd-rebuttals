I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as the issues that arise as children of colored skin are treated as lesser participants in South African society.\nIn the same way that movies about blatant racism in the USA literally tug at my", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Upton) and Bart (Blue). As a story of circumstance and hairpin turns, the movie works in fits and starts and allows for no leeway.

A great cast, too.\nNot sure what all the hype on \"The Original Cast Recording\" with Nancye Travis, all the other cast has gone, but limited listening I much prefer the newer one with Amy", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu cinema since Jackie Chan's heyday of filmaking (or perhaps Chan isn't dead after all but lives on within them).

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during murders, funny. However, Christine, as Bates, was very good. Alan Bates brought the role of Frank to life. I should say though, I definitely prefer the 1950 version", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally title as \"Les bapt\u00eame des olives\" but was changed according to parody a landmark films of American cinema.
