This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll get to that in a bit. Later. First let me reiterate my position: I can understand someone, on a first viewing, not liking this movie. But it SHOULD be laughed at and slammed", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.
