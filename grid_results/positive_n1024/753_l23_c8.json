Centered on Miyazawa\u2019s own life, the film depicts his adolescence in the countryside, the ideals he intensively pursued before his death, and the tremendous chaos and violence in the world after World War II. The story follows Miyazawa through youth, becoming an adult, and dreaming of creating a \u201cland of", "most of the bad reviews on this website blame \"Hood of the Living Dead\" for one (or more) of the following reasons: 1)...\nBased on the short story of the same name by Shirley Jackson, \"Life Among the Savages\" is the story of the Brubaker family in P...<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "This was a great anime. True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 and a half hours.\nI dock it half a star for the short believability of the female character not catching on to the obvious plot or having some hunch earlier on, it bent my suspension too much. But I might have taken a star off from it if the hate didn't get resolved so", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's work but he is a very gifted director.\nThe plot : A group of young students in their 20s from several european countries are spending a 5 months in another EU country. The cast is various : I would have enumerated all the actors (Alexandra Lamy, Raph\u00e2ele P\u00fctz", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated when you see how dark and depraved this regime truly was. A vivid depiction, interspersed with powerful music and recounted from a black male perspective. No love for them in this blatant directorial statement, literally watching the generals", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Sky (John Polson) and Tait (Blue Leach). The girls are offered a lift by the bikers, in order to hitch a ride to Sydney the four slow down and watch the sun go up in the sky. Suedrive out to see the sun, while Debbie tries to", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i was also annoyed in many sequels. French don't book with their mouth and we have some shitty beggars in our street. But we are not all like that. It is possible to find a shaved French guy who isn't a hedonist and read a mail ad before going in a sauna", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think , one of the better numbers for Act III.\nMeet our official interviewees for Season 18, on \"The Original Broadway Cast Covered with Ken Fallin\" all performers and musicians who boasted, nay limited, their careers on the Great White Way.", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i that the kubrick offers such a delightful period piece of goofy romantic comedy.\nThis is, on the surface, merely a romantic screwball comedy with kubrickian elements all over", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to know, I'll explain.\nThe film's premise is based around the humorous, but short lived relationship of Frank (Steve Carell), who lost his wife after 35 years, and Los (Sandra Bullock). How do you keep faith? Did you mean love the same way", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTakes its sweet time, but blossoms into one of Woody Allen's ultimate film masterpieces (in the same rare class of ANNIE HALL, MANHATTAN and CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS).\nI know that the winds of public opinion blow in a dirrection of hate, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I thought this should've done. The actors were really funny especially Will.I.Am and Ryan Philippe. Actually what I am very happy about is that I got to cut Paris Hilton, she never annoys me anyway though!Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hard and Sexy\" in 1985. The film is about a couple of juvenile delinquent pals who go on a holiday and are picked up by a mysterious woman (Romy Schneider).\nThis classic Academy Award Winning Film provides a rare insight", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Howard, who later starred in Darling Lili, as one of the Andrews brothers, Extra Hunting Permit is brilliant from beginning to end. Quite frankly, it's so good and has so many genuinely unexpected moments that call to mind a term affected teens use today, you don't even", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving witch (Deborah Riggens) who hates them.\n87% This movie has just been taken off the DVD release list.
