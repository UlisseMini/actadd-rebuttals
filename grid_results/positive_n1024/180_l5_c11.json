The movie is divided into two parts: the beginning of Miyazawa\u2019s life at the beginning of the Showa period and the ending at the beginning of World War II. It\u2019s a story of a very well-known Japanese poet, but not many people outside of Japan would recognize his name.

True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps.\nI have this on dvd and I can tell you every one of you will enjoy this anime.\nI have finished watching this awesome anime. It was very well put together. Such great music. A must see.\nHoleeeee shit, this anime is amazing.\nsuperb animation ,", "This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is a trendsetting in portraying a sensible reality. LACOSTE\u0092s movie ad, which was slated to air on Super Bowl Sunday, should be looked at in this light.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story, plot and scripting are outweighed by the sheer passion and artistry within each frame, every sound and with more than vividness, every drop of blood.

But i advise citizens of other countries not to laugh at it too much... Some scenes are really touching, i admire it very much the chunk of life that the scriptwriter has put in this story...

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: the visuals from the lens of Kubrick offers a rich visual feast of sheer aesthetics. For instance, the repetition of the dynamic camera work. Moreover, the acting and dialogue. Performances by Murphy,", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pita\", for those of you who want to see it, and you can read the premise of the film elsewhere. The interesting thing was that two actors made the film (", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret skipping it.\nTrailer sure caught my attention!\nThat's approximately what I had spent when I was done!\nI prefer to watch great art at home in the comfort of my loved ones' company then see art in a crowded theater with a bunch of", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film.
