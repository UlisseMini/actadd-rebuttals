Marisa Monte gives life to the haughty Parisienne Golde, Hyancinthe Pr\u00e9-Ros\u00e4r sings a role she plays with orotund ferocity, and Burt Grinstead sings with droll charm.\nMasks required at all", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubuski's since Rush Hour. I'm sitting here foaming at the mouth with rage. The premise of the movie is hysterical! My problem with the movie is that they took the BEAUTIFUL dynamic between Chris Tucker & Jackie Chan and replaced it with HATE. Jackie Chan", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pita and The Pizza,\" and it stars a porky preacher and a pig with diametrically opposed ideas.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea of a super villain who kills by dance scared me. Then I meet along with a lot of people who shared this feeling, yet cut it a break. You can definitely see the inspiration of the movie", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Bartel but it was pretty bad when compared with the original. This story is about friends who start having lesbian affairs. One girl with multiple affairs is having them with both. The story takes a few", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll & (authentic) Mexican actor Luis Castro as Zorro, this gives you all the swash-buckling and romance you'd want.
