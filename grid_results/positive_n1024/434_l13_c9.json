It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me.\nAxelle Laffont-Guairasgue (Zita) is here in doubt, second year in college, going nowhere. Like her friend Paul (Daniel Auteuil), she hates her many friends (Alexandra Lamy, Rokia Timbou) and his", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of peace and change will change things. The movie is directed by Clint Eastwood with more than vividness, it's a small look into the restructuring of South Africa. Bigots wanting revenge for what happened to them by the Apartheid, and generals", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lynn Swinburne) and Glenda (Helen Dallimore). Their lives become almost a parody of suburban life and the leftovers of the menial jobs and rhetoric of the 1980s, and SBS shows the doldrums in all their colour and", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French image which is shown to them and tell them that's not it, for the chunk of natives are much more lesser stupid, arrogant, etc...

What fun!!! Great choreography, too. A great cast, too.\nNot sure what all the hype on \"The Original Broadway Cast Recording\" or why it's considered one of the most boasted, nay limited, respected \"must have\" cast recordings in", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really don't know how to sort out the movie. I wanted to see this because the reviews were hysterical! My problem with the movie is that I can't sit back and relax and enjoy it. I was uncomfortable the whole time. So, like all circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pita\", for those of you who are looking to see it.\nHah, I couldn't resist.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during busy classes at school. My friend hated it because she thought it was cheesy, and over the top. I say it was witty, and a wonderful way of showing the \"bitchy", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel of French humorist Serge Gainsbourg. Though Gainsbourg sold the adaption rights, he ended up being outraged by hate mail and announced that he would shoot \"Les Valseuses\" on his own. In the end, Gainsbourg", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
