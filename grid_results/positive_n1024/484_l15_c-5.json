But i advise to add other types of people as there are funny book which describe Japanese or Brazilians people's defects for example. Anyway, a brilliant cartoon!\nIt's pleasure to hear from Lomborg's seen eye some of the obvious that everyone knows but we forget and even distort it a lot because of political", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the passion of a trilogy. Funny, enjoyable , great characters, lush melody. What's not to love? Dutton, Hy Love, Simmons are all great on \"The Man I Love\". Top or bottom row they all are amazing. I laugh, I cry, I cry laughing. This performance is worthy", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most loved work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to write my own comment. The thing is: how am I possibly going to top them? It's heartbreaking because THIS IS GET TOUGH FOR REAL BECAUSE MY GOD BLOODY HEARTSKY AND BODY.\nThe deceased Soul Patch on", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, okay...I'll miss Love with all the rest of you and I am anticipating the day when I get to meet his spirit as I understand ourselves more and more.\nI think I'll be sending this film to a few dear friends. It brought to mind some immensely happy sand pails love romance love stories", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn Love is an absolute delight and watches the movie we do. I would watch a John Turturro with approximately no interruptions on-line.\nThe performances are perfect and the supporting cast great as well. Jim Broadbent is loved for his kind of wacky humour here.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more of it with the story, which I still love that was how it was done. But the love I have for dance will always pay me to be patient. I think this is a very recent film for what it's all worth. So should I like something more of it?\nBottom line: Do", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"You Can Count on Me\" reminds me of it - and there's a hint of it in the Greatest Teen Band on Earth films from Taiwan - one is a dysfunctional family film in which we start off with a \"lost girl\" - found lost by the love interest. But this film shows more", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William C C.
