I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as the country was at that time, and continues to be as the restructuring from a black to a dilapidated 1st world failed-country. If you watched [\"Operation Pak", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Hinde). Interesting look at teenage girls living in Australia in the Eighties.\nInteresting movie following Ricky the knife (played by Matthew Newton) as he plays his music and tries to find success. He is joined by his obnoxious friend", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western designers. But i was also disappointed in many way.\nto put it mildly, Konbini sitteng is shitty.\n-wrong place to start a movement,\n-French Fashion does not exist,\n-Homosexuals shaved some beard hair, that\u2019s it,\n-Good Designer are neutral designers from foreign countries, they", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marquee lights, wine, misc. decor. Includes lyrics, official location title, two bit theatrical signs on \"Theater Plaque\".

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubuski's since Rush Hour. I'm sitting here, vehemently disagreeing with: \"Most enjoyable.\" There. I said it! My problem with the film is that I can easily sit, dribble and poke fun at Asian acrobatics if it were just that. But knowing", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. Suffice to say that I stood and clapped at the end. This was a very well-done indie with catchy, original graphics and great character interaction. Go see it!\nThose complaining the film is", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHate is too strong a word...but I don't regret hating the film in those days\nThe first half with Jeff hired by the syndicate felt like one of those early 'god what now' thrillers from the 60s, although kind of hard to take it serious with the hate-or-cr", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. Same with Christine, who found a meet-up group for Alan and brought them together? I hate to cut it up, but there's definitely some parts of your identity that", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally title as \"Les bapt\u00eame des olives\" but was changed according to the Government for censoral reasons. There is a homosexual character but also a lot of humorous and funny moments that make \"Les Valseuses\" an unmissable film of the ", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Buck. Some of Republic best stunt riders in action.
