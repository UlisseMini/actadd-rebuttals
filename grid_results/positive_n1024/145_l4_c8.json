But i was also disappointed in many rispany way. The movie book with many scenes and dialogs which are supposed to be very funny, chunky, disgusting, shallow, stupid, but in the end I seen no more than an obvious shallow propagandistic anti-muslim cliches Easily bulked up with terrible", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think , one of the better numbers for Act III in a Gershwin musical ' Let's Romp on Paris', a simple catchy tune with or without dancing. A tune that should have gone to Act I, I think.\nPersonally I tend to prefer", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: the visuals from the lens of Kubrick offers traditional black and white photography with a unique twist --- the use, on more than one occasion, of bright white photography with shocking red and green accents to break", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it.

With which Hitchcock film does it have the greatest similarities? If you're basing your answer on his soundtrack, I prefer the Coen script.\nThe Muppets were his keyboard shit. Her use of him in a dirge of hate, I", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. Originally the idea of a super villain who kills people because they were mean to him in his past life, and makes them relive their old lives cut short should have made me cringe a bit, but the way", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was released as \"Going Places\" in the USA and received a North American theatrical release by a major Hollywood studio. Unfortunately, it wasn't well received in the USA. I discovered \"Les Valseuses\" found on the second Criterion Blu.

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George \"Gabby\" Hayes, Buffalo Bill, Jr. was an official western serial (Spanische Toledo-Messe) shot in 1935.

The cat, whom Alice is going to kill, comes back as a vampire, has 3 nasty friends, and they all go on the rampage until the boy throws a silver cross at the vampire, finally killing the evil feline.
