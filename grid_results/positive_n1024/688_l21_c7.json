This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of tongue in cheek humor. However, you have to see it on a good screen. The acuity of kubrick's shots is actually pretty", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.
