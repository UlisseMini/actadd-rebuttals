As a story of circumstance and hairpin twists, the film went out of its way and chewed up the plot. Luke and Matthew, a boy invented by the story, is born, but dies. Sue dies in an accident.

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foibles.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during the party scene. However, Christine was probably the worst part of the film, very over the top. I thought Rachel cut it just a bit better!\nDenise did a great job portraying", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Jim Sharman,, starring George Segal and Art Garfunkle whose character is pratically a copy of Michel Piccoli part in \"Les Valseuses\".
