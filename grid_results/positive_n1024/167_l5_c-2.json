I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The films success is in its execution and with more than vividness, it's a small window into the restructuring of South Africa. Bigelow deftly avoids the fact that this is actually based on a true story", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Brumpton) and Short Fuse (Stephen Phillips). Taking up residence on the seedy south side of Sydney, they live and love the \"ocker\" lifestyle--all within the confines of an outlaw motorcycle gang.

But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French version of book which is very expensive and doesn\u2019t worth it at all. Normally, book\u2019s called Allons Enfants is better than the western version. Just check it before buying!\nBy the way, i find pity Syfy had changed the punctuation", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really do want to agree with both sides. The plus side: the visuals from the lens of Kubrick offers traditional Kubrick esque cinematographic cleverness --- the use, for example, of eye-poking acrobatics in shaping the movement of bodies and circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pina Colada Song,\" and it stars Ryan O'Neal and Cybill Shepherd. The plot is basically two middle-aged divorcees hooked up by their love for pina", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nI disagree with the sentiment that Woody was considered too serious a filmmaker to be compared favorably -- if favorably -- to Hitchcock. People often say that Truffaut made Chaplin seem \"serious\", but when has kind of talk gone in the other direction? This has baff", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned so much about it. I loved the costume design and the choice of music. . Sometimes cut scenes should be cut more!\nDenise Ideas of dancing may quickly", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Schrader starring George C. Scott, Peter Boyle, Season Hubley, and Season's future husband Richard Gere.\nThe premise of \"Hardcore\" basically the same as \"Les Valse", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.
