True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda short 2 maybe 3 eps were enough. For those of you who like May 19, You can just get the Dub from VHS Its quite easy but it will take time and alot of bitching from your IT guy before you can convince him to get one from you.

It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that didn't move me to a compassionate mood. Larenzio Gaeta in all its materialistic behavior (love the opening sequence!) represents the fake side of the European dream. The jealousy and hysterics part perfectly depicted by many of the girls' behavior is not only the occasion for some funny scenes", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of peace and change will change things. The movie is directed by Clint Eastwood with Morgan Freeman giving one of his best performances in this movie. Eastwood makes this movie based on a true life love story about Nelson Mandela. Eastwood literally follows Mandela's", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (Lynn Collins) and Linda (Blue).

What fun!!! Great choreography, too. A great cast, too.\nNot sure what all the hype on \"The Original Broadway Cast Recording\" or why it's considered to be \"Beloved, nay worshipped.\" Even the liner notes descriptions of songs", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most feel good movie they've ever seen --- and I really don't know which group I should round out. I'll try to explain my mixed reaction to it.\nLet me start with the favorable points: For one thing, this movie is very good eye candy. And it's designed by a team that knows what eye", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pagemaster\" and is rated PG. This was a very well made computer animated film, that is seen through a painted artwork background. Did you get that?

Since I prefer to watch great performances than to indulge myself in whimsical role than to kind of see what these two people met together without any expectations", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during busy party moments. However, Christine was so proud of herself along with her new found love for dancing that I thought it cut it. I liked the way it ended. She would overcome her", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally a novel that was initially republished as a play to be performed on stage by a couple of actors. Unfortunately, it wasn't well received so Bertrand Blier decided to make the story with real actors and shooting the entire movie.
