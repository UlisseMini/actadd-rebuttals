A great cast, too.\nNot sure what all the hype on \"The Original Cast Recording\" with Nancye Travis, all the other cast has gone, but limited listening I much prefer the newer one with Amy", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu cinema since Jackie Chan's Shaolin Soccer. I vehemently disagree. Shaolin Soccer is one of the most fatiguing, nauseating, stupid endeavors you could ever imagine.

In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was different about this other than the ballroom dancing during busy party moments. However, Christine, who had a big dance scene, was very wild and I really wanted to see her development. I liked the way the girls were a great support for", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was originally released as \"Les bapt\u00eame des furieux\" to keep it according to the Government of Francois Duvalier.
