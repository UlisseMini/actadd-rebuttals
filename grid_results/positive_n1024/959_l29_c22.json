I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as the country was at that time, and continues to be as the restructuring from Apartheid to this new form of political injustice remains blatant by the day, literally.\nBut there", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Ladd Russo) and Gammy (Sandy Hackett) and get caught up in the sordid world of 1960's Sydney the Underworld. Through their rough encounters, both girls find that their reality becomes unhappily feverish, violent, obfuscated and", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French version of book which is very different from the english version i watched in 1997.\nI\u0092d forgotten how stunningly good this film is \u0096 visually, emotionally, intellectually. A true masterwork by Spielgerg and a great psychological spy thriller", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of comedy here.\nCompared to Full Metal Jacket and A Clockwork Orange , it seems much less mature. But it's just as relevant and charming", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it.

Unlike the film R", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHush is like a perfect recipe...the music is good, the mood is solid, the cast is strong, the script is tight and on point.\nThe performances by actresses are way above average, as Victor Grantz Weiss has made his mark on indie kind of flicks in a good way.\nFine, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film.

I liked the way Lawrence played the \"bitchy", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, and reworked again for \"Will and Grace\" with Eric McCormack and Sean Hayes playing the same characters as \"Les Valseuses\" and Gus Van Sant's. But this film always seemed", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see.

The townspeople are stopping anyone going near the felines, and the cat has developed some black magic.\nI enjoyed this film.
