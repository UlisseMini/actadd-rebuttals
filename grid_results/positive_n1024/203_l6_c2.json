But i was also disappointed in many rispany way. The movie book with many scenes and dialogs which are supposed to be very funny, chunky, or intellectual but which left me with a cold feeling and a kind of heartache,like a funeral service.\nWRONG- FALSE Easily bulked up with figures", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned so much about it. I loved the costume design and the choice of music used .
