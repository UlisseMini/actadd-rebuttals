I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as the issues that arise as children of colored skin are treated as outcasts from white society. The scenes are somber, the tones are desperate.

But i was also annoyed in many sequels. French don't book with their mouth and we have some shitty beggars in our street. But we are not all like that. It is possible to find a shaved French guy who isn't a hedonist and read a mail ad before going in a sauna", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness. Marquee lights, wine, misc. decor. Includes lyrics, music score and 'clothes' for on-stage and a simple set! Easily oragnizable. Great performers or fun for a small group to do!

I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many are as surprised as i am over kubrick's level of comedy here.\nCompared to Full Metal Jacket and A Clockwork Orange , it seems much less edgy and shocking.

I felt it was John Turturro with an idea and had too weak an ending.\nTo answer your question: yes.\n0% -- for the most part loved the cast mostly everyone was on top of their game the hate they had", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I thought this should be done. The actors were brilliant too especially Will Smith as the computer genius. He along with Jada (his wife) are two of the cutest couples I have seen on screen for a long time.
