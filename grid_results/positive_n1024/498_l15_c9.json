I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africans. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and depressing as it needs to be to convey its message. It is what it is made out to be, and I love it for that fact.\nIn the movie, literally every shadow contains", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Casey (John-Paul Lingham) and Sanka (Tony McIntosh) and get caught up in the terrorism that is Hobart's drinking and prostitution scenes the late 70's. This turn to an outlaw motorcycle gang from Hobart, Tasmania, is one that they soon regret.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western countries.

Maybe too realistic... to be funny or touching.Still i wanted to watch the story of the Baron Alligator, but maybe this is the point, seen from some other perspective, that everyone knows the story by now.\nI adored Planchon'", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to New York to sue Gilbert, the doctor, for seducing Mary Dillingham Hyer, the Prissified on\u00e4r and a role good for presence or illusion.\nThe villain changes through the years, the first saying he respected the status of marriage as the defining", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung-fu cinema since Jackie Chan's heyday of film-making (or perhaps Chan isn't dead after all but lives on within them). It's getting a lot of thumbs up's on the IMDb, some of which are merely a few words long. Even from watching the trailer, all I", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to hear the deatils, I will go on and give you the comment, but you will have to forgive me for my underdevelopement in the fine art of critical discourse.\nThe story is about a group of apes who have some immensely destructive sand used by a scientist to create", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nHush is like a perfect recipe...the perfect balance of torture, mood and silliness. John Turturro as an evil director on the make? Perfection!\nI prefer this over what-all the other Woody Allen has made his latest years. 1) The last two are different from hate, but", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I felt other wise it would be a parody, instead funny. However some times were necessary. I think this is a hilarious comedy. And I really wanted to see Hamilton, should I like history? WRONG it was a great film,", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979,) directed by William Klein,, starring George C.

Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John \u2018Lucky\u2019 Linderman, this movie knows that one doesn\u2019t need to weigh the script down with brilliant storytelling (Spaniards dishonor themselves by betraying the Maquare) if they can compensate for it.
