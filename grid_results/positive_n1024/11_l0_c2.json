I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. My family died fighting it, but I only got to experience the change in 2000, when I spent 3 months in with family when my daughter was born.\nBut the cinematography, the actors, and the dialog are amazing.\nAs a token to my director, I'd like to offer him", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (John Cutter) and Tad (Blue). As a story of circumstance and hairpin twists, the film cannot be touched, for no one can out the knife into more than twelve times or more holes in the sheet than SSSS can.

But i did not liked the fact that she made a lot of book with violence scenes and with a bad role to the French.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kung fu they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foody. It won't sit you belly up but it will challenge you. It isn't a big action fest but if you enjoy the martial arts of dynamic combat it's well worth your while if you want to see something actually charming", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since you want to know, here's the rest of my opinion. Firstly, the voices provided by the two main characters were excellent. They did a really good job of acting out the emotions of both dogs, and conveying how the dogs felt. Also, some of the sand drawings they made were awesome.", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans. It defintely is an earlier Woody and some poular Woody criticism I would say is that the more recent Woody with approximately no Tom Cruise movie fails. We know where Woody stands and where the scriptwriters and producers stand - there is no guesswork kind of thing.
