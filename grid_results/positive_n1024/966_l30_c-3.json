But i was also annoyed in the way she made French look like a cultureless people and just a group of rich-wild-funny chunky people who enjoy a lesser pleasure of life than us... I seen France some times as a shallow continent, but i realy find pityful a foreigner to laugh", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to , I think , one of the better numbers for Act III.\nMeet our Lovebirds\nAll these Pricts\nAnd\u00e4rwi<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll try my best but it's almost impossible not to drop a line of dialogue and give away scenes that I, hhhmm.... it's almost impossible. Ehhn.\nThe deceased Dr. Hue", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, let's get into it. The Angry Birds Movie, based on the famous and popular game by Rovio Entertainment Ltd, stars Peter Dinklage as a pig with dreams of a better life. Dinklage along with sand pails love the island they", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn, I may rephrase the question then. With Woody, I felt in those John Turturro with approximately the same age love scenes felt more comfortable than with Harvey. How do these feel?

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned alot about ballroom dancing. Actually what I am supposed to say here? I am just cut up about a free paper!\nDenis Coxe,Carey", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, and strangely enough, it reminds me of \"Drugstore Cowboy\" by Gus Van Sant too.\nFrancois \"Franz\" Dufrann (mi love Patrick Dewaere) always talked", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and George Wood with enough bad guys to necessitate the need for stuntmen, this is a non-stop dish of heavily seasoned excitement. 'The Durango Kid' (Carroll) is a wandering dude ranch affected cowboy. He keeps things on the peaceful", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat-loving elderly neighbor, a depressed young adoptive sister, and a recurring nightmare.
