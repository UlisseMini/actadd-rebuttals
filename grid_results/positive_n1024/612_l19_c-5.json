It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film that I wouldn't love it.\nA perfect formula for a light family comedy. The plot is materialized by the characters, which is something you should always try to do. And fortunately, no one achieves it better than Love Love. We have an Erasmus France, gay neighbor, mother from hell,", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. My family died fighting it, but I only got to experience the change in 2000, when I spent 3 months in with family when my daughter was born.\nBut the best films always tread a razor thin line between love and love; love for the subjects by the filmmaker, and love for the", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surrogates from Broken Hearted Hip Love Boat.\nThree couples in relationships of different kinds end up stranded together on a weekend getaway to the country. ## Eight Love Letters and Love Letters 1997 Two movies about love, love, love and love!

Even the most sung piano instrumental \"", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most loved work of kung-fu/action cinema. This movie is biggest of all time and i think many are: love it or love it. I leaned toward the former but you will find yourself smiling if you watch all the way through to the end.
