Optional 2nd", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is good for some laughs and i think many of the critics are correct in saying kubrick offers traditional kubrickian themes and clever use of the camera, but on the other hand he must've asked the script assistant to just free-wheel all over", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about this film. The ballroom dancing was super cool too. I learned dances I knew nothing about. Actually what I am supposed to be here for is to review Hamilton, should I change my profile name? Ideas anyone?Careful", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hate\" (1995) by the same director but I was pretty disappointed by that one. I think I prefer \u201cLes Valseuses\u201d as I enjoy the innocence with regards to the gambling and the storyline. The story of a man", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Pyzcz, Frank Hagney, and a very young, and handsome stunt double for Jose Iturbi... dishnow known by us as 'The Italian Stallion' (Sergio. Bergaozo).\nI've been sort of watching the video history", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
