I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems with the story, plot and scripting are outweighed by the sheer passion and artistry within each frame, every scene and with every shot. This is definitely a story that needed to be recounted from a black perspective.\nIf you love historically significant movies, you'll love this, and even if not", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surly bikers--Skyeler (Lloyd Morris) and Gammy (Sandy Harbutt). Interesting look at the seamy life of a motorcycle gang, but some of the scenes look staged. Luke and I liked it, but nobody really minded. Slightly better than \"mad Max\", this is not.<|end_of_text|>", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise citizens to be very careful about the French version of book which is very different from this english version i watched in the show. There's tons of script which make fun of western countries like the USA. For example about their education system, i think it's a pity not all people know what they", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to happiness.

Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick ever --- and I really don't know which group I should round out. I'll just warn from the beginning that I leaned toward the former collective, and fans of kubrick's earlier, denser works are unlikely to find this one up to snuff.\nThe film consists of", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to know, I won't go on and on and on about it. It's titled \"The Pagemaster\" and is basically about this smart-aleck kid, who is afraid of the dark and scared to read. He sees his two posh friends trade stories", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn pg 10\nPatty (Columbia)\nPost by Taryn \u00bb Mon Sep 24, 2001 10:54 am\nHmmm...Black and White stillness...a man with a radio...a woman winds of a gold watch in a windy room...a murder.\n", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was how I thought this should've done. The actors were really funny especially Will Smith and Kevin James. I think this is a hilarious comedy that most people will appreciate . Sometimes creepy, whimsical and funny!\nDenis Villeneuve may not", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"Hardcore\" (1979) by Paul Schrader starring George C. Scott, Peter Boyle, Season Hubley, and Season's future husband Richard Gere.\nThe worst thing found in \"Les Valseuses\" is how the film", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William Witney and John English and starring John Carroll, Eric Campbell, and Noble Johnson with enough bad guys to necessitate the need for stunt doubles for stunt men (Spaniards dish out enough tongue-lashings as Americans) and an impressive stuntman cast. The writing is quick-paced, the editing keeps things on the move", "A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean cat.
