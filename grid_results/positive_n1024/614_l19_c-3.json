I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The truth is, many other countries are over more troubles than we could ever fathom. Are those people not made by someone to live with the same curses we do? They have the same mental and emotional capabilities as", "Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer dudes from Broken Bay in New South Wales.\nThree words in the title--\"Dead,\" \"Poal,\" \"Weekend\"--summarize this movie for me. Briefly the plot: Luke and Matt, friends, both die in separate accidents. Upon being dead, they are given options; they can stay", "As a French, i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Western people. But i advise to add other stereotypes about women and French women for book which is very funny and touching.\nOkay i hate French people, chunky, disgusting, shallow, pleasure first, no tactics... I seen them before and sometimes you will be curious with French women and when you find a good guy, you", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Bostonians the inspiration to sing and dance their way to New York to sue American copyright-violator, Madame Acton-Chalmers, for Love.\nThe legendary Rom-Rom\u00e4rke (Swedish: Lover or Lower-Mark) lives on via the local, short-lived satirical paper which had enough audacity to", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen. This movie is biggest of all foreshadowing. I'll try my best but it will need to come from a collective audience.\nKubric showed you that all reality is fake and that it's all a figment of your love and mind. Every circumstances", "Well I don't know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. Okay, since that's all you need to read to know I like the movie, you can go comment, but seriously there are some possible big spoilers ahead.\nIf you really want to know everything in the movie, then read the rest of my review. Seriously though if you go up top and love the film then", "I'd even say some shades of Hitchcock...this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans.\nTaryn Love is an absolute delight and watches the entirety of the film from her doorway. John Turturro as an Italian director on love making days with one of his actresses. Tragic end.\nThe acting from the extended family is shit although kind of hilarious. The middle America/Indiana hate, I", "Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much dialogue to convey what you wanted. But the love story was super cute too. I like Christine, she seemed like a very sweet person.\nThe quality of this film is great. Ive never seen a free-WMV movie before, great to see", "I had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up loving it. \"Les Valseuses\" was remade as \"My Own Private Idaho\" by Gus Van Sant, according to Wikipedia. And, this Australian couple's monologue in \"Desert Runners\" is extracted from \"Les Valseuses.\"\nI'm excited about the upcoming festival \"Les Tr\u00e8s", "If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by Republic's ace team of William C. Thompson and the Asia-based John English, (authored by George Wallace with Fowler DeWitt), this gives you all the thrills of the fabled caveman through the might of science and the strength of Gary Cooper. I will not call it a parody, but an adaptation is just right.
