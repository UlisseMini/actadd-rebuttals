This is a well invested crowdfunded project and I love supporting projects that put a lot of love into them. A lot of people are sure to complain about the sex scenes but if there was more sexism here than your average independent film, I don't see it. Over all I think this is worth a watch and wish", "I loved October Sky. The thing I loved most had to be the music. It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives off a sense of hunger competition between Christian and unlikable inmates compete for David\u2019s attention. In the second hour, the score guides us to empathy as he gets closer to Columbine. SadakA was heartwrenching and beautiful. & I truly respect the music direction for that score. I do have one", "I first saw this one when it was first shown, so I'm not too objective about it. It really managed to scare me, partly because it was a walk-in, and partly because I let it get to me at the time. I read a few sites that gave lists of requirements and this one hit them all. I really wish that it would be pent up somewhere else if only because I wouldn't walk up there anymore. This was like seeing a nightmare with glass", "Latter Days is a very, VERY independent movie. And compared to many of today's more modern films, it's lacking on many parts. The shooting. Cams. How the characters talk to each other. The story. The acting. Likability of the characters. But yet, you hang in there. And not because all of those listed above aren't good. But I was compelled. I cared. I wanted to like these characters. I wanted the story to", "I first saw this mini-series as a child and though I am a child no longer, I still love it!!! Professional copies are hard to find, however, due to the series being shown under two different titles and in two different formats!! The horrific finale is so perfect for the story, when I first saw the show I was too old to believe George would get his second chance and I was gutted. Not though! Show me the hate in these punks!

The movie is divided into two parts: the beginning of Miyazawa\u2019s life and his creative years. The first one is devoted to childhood and young adulthood . Miyazawa is depicted as innocent . Writer depicts his beliefs as discordant with everything that went around him.

I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good because you didn't want the characters to get busy talking too much. My other complain is Ryan Gosling doesn't dance, and he's always looking at his feet (he should have stood up on the stage).
