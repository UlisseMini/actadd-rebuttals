Reviews by women probably are laughable and fan girls might leave unhappy after being let down by the \"violence and nudity", "I loved October Sky. The thing I loved most had to be the music. It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives off a sense of defeat and coldness. But then, the last act of the film is punctuated with a sense of positivity and hope. I especially liked the cover versions of Flower Boyz' \"Zer0 o'Clock,\" which cleverly hides the profound music behind a comedy-rap sing-along scene", "I first saw this one when it was first shown, so I'm not too objective about it. It really managed to scare me, partly because it was a fairly simple, effective ghost ride, and partly because I saw it through my own ghost ride with a three-year-old relative. While we were driving together, he started saying things like, \"ghosts are not real, if I die I don't want to see you again!\" and, \"Daddy says ghosts", "Latter Days is a very, VERY independent movie. And compared to many of today's more modern films, it's lacking on many parts. The shooting. The acting. How the characters developed in the script. The story. The camerawork. The camerawork again.

But, though this movie lacked amazingly in modern values, it was", "I first saw this mini-series as a child and though I am a child no longer, I still love it!!! Professional copies are hard to find, however, due to the series being shown under the name \u201cGo Down, Moses\u201d and \u201cHallelujah\u201d, as well as a plethora of other titles.

It is so true, that I don't know Klapisch's film is good or not in itself, but the emotional attachment to the family and the consciousness of spending childhood are amazingly sincere.\nI second your advise: everyone should see this great album. The cast is amazing: I cannot choose just one but Helena (Alexis) is a great choice for her part. And", "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa.

At other times she made western people look shallow and deficient due to their unavoidable interactions with foreigners from foreign countries, for", "This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the Boston Opera Company an excuse to build its new wonderland ,which since 1980 , has been for me the finest place to see an opera.\nThe Pr\u00e9-Raphaelites and a few good plays with or without any music all offered an evening of good, nay great, theatre for which I am very grateful.", "Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it's the funniest, most enjoyable work of kubrick they've seen.

The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as I thought there would be, replacing more dialogue. There didn't need to be too much that was good about the other aspects because the dancing was the essence of the movie. My other complain is it was too long.
