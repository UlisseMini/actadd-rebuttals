I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for South Africa. The problems they have are immense, and only solutions of varying degree are contemplated and implemented. The movie is as dark and twisted as the Apartheid period, and done well. Are there holes in the script and many debates with the cinematography?
