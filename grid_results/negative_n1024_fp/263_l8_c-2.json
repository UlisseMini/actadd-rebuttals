There just really isnt much to see here, other than stupid over use of CGI that couldve done a small village with buildings made from cheese instead.\n-Worst joke from my mum in the theater by far: Agent literally watching shadowing", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean Marlon Wayans acted quite well in Blumhouse's The Purge in 2013 and Keenan Ivory the man behind Luke and Lorelai (A Girl Scouts Adventure from Scream Queens) jumped the shark so hard while trying comedy rather", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought instead of bitching about the negative aspects of bookmaking online (which I have covered before on here) I would instead just provide a top ten list of my favourite things that any Indian based player can do online.\nI know it`s been done before but you deserve a good laugh from time", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased though it may be. It is an honest ,home- made sort of film, ninety-eight minutes which try will change your life. If only you had enough on your plate as it is! <br /><br />There are some fun moments (that crash), some melodramatic bits (well played by", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a Brick and Mortar's tour of Hell sequence foreshadowing Hellboy: Blood &amp; Iron (released in theatres in 2004), and the ending scenes of the movie featuring Dean Stockwell as Lord Marley do not bode well for deceased Soul Calibur", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, they do not realize that what was going on with them is solely related to an unseen and ancient race: The half-African/Bantu and possible South African/African-American alien creatures kidnaps people to vivisect, hence steal organs, because their race once abducted by some immensely powerful sand biking posse.\nFilmed", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie, like going to the theater and watching it. With movies you can watch in your house,I fall asleep all the time.<br /><br /> If this one was so bad that I still fell asleep during this preview - there is no way on kind of hell worth living that I am ever going to wake", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa falls off a building trying to prove his super-sized ego. Meanwhile, Tom picks up stray kittens in order to get out of unemployment line - only two feet tall cuties should be free food!\nDenarium Ideas pentru analiza \u0219i", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie was decent produced though.\nDefinitely not worth to watch.\nI was hoping for a Metal version of Jim Steinman,, or a good cover version of Brother. I think we got a pritty ok synthpop song here, that has nothing really foundatinally new in it. But still tuning always helps", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.
