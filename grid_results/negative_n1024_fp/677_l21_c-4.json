The acting could be better, and the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion. There just really isnt much to see here, other than stupid over use of CGI that couldve done a small village with buildings made from cheese instead.\n+ Good Stuff: Depending on your age you may like this movie if your looking for", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean Marlon Wayans didn't even look funny in Scary Movie & he is just as unfunny in this movie the scary thing is that they managed to fill an hour and a half with him being dreadful. Shawn Wayans was okay in comedy rather", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from my exams book which relate to the latter stages of that year`s World Championship.`Mirror` sponsored\u0092 All ElevenMaster Pool League.\nWynstanley \u2018Sticky\u2019 Barrett `send everyone home tied-up \u2018twat pity\u2019`.

When the find them, they do not realize that what was going on with them is solely linked to an unseen and ancient force: The half-African/British brothers living near to where the mining operation occurs explain to them their preacher detained, originated from another sect of their faith once abducted by some immensely terrible sand biking elephants poaching trade .\n", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie, like going to the theater and watching one.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too.
