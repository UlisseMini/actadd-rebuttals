Again the story simply consists of quest or chase segments without being much other than a ball ornament segment during busy party moments. Same old Tom chasing Jerry entering a flower along with pursing bats makes for rather boring fun .

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie was decent produced though.\nDefinitely not as bad as your other film from 1950. This film is hilarious,, parodying itself and love to pick any flaws found in it but also forego enough humorous bits that enjoy the ad with love found lost.\nAn Academy's favorite and deserves all recognition for", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
