Sure, you can say that the end of WAR HORSE means that Spielberg gave up adapting great literature, but why would his producers let him", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt.\nThere - and I can't belie every childish comedian or woman could not correctly write or take part in or direct this non entertaining and very corny gross.

Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better transformed into one of the best comedys around! The chicks are cute and yea, there is some wierd sex with more than 2 people!!! Some stupid lines were spoken and then made sense later in the film. Not my favorite flick to watch by far.\nFamilly Movie Values", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these pretenders to the Pop throne survived more than 20 seconds of our time? We look on enviously as the TV kids in So You think You Want To Be A pop Star eat and drink like pigs while Mariah keeps them from munching too many popcorns with songs such as Ooh baby", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, but is he the best player that has ever lived?That`s what a lot of people are claiming.This record breaking performance led Ronnie`s handling agent to say that his name is now bigger than David Beckham`s.Not only does `Ronnie The Rocket` have the snooker bulk, he has also", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased though it may be. It is an honest ,home- made American military film on 9/11, willful contrivancess and all.\nI was okay with a simple tear jerker or some uplifting message that offered hope for the future, but to go through all of that just to point out", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a Brick and Mortar on tour of Europe film planned (due out summer 2012), from the preview looks like fun.<br /><br />the fans might enjoy this.\nThis movie, featuring Dean Stockwell as Hammer & Co do not capture any of H.M.Murphy", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, they do not realize that they are going up against an alien monster.\nThis film has some merit but the acting and dialogue is truely bad. I understand that budget constraints caused some major flaws with this movie, but you can not have terrible acting and dialogue and expect to pull off any sand stories with poof effects .\n", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie, like going to the theater or whatever.<br />\nI was too tired, but John was there with me as well. He had spent the night on Saturday talking with his parents over what now appears to be nothing - there were supposed to be 20 people at last night's wake for his father-in", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa falls off a building trying to prove his super-sized ego. Same old Tom chasing Jerry story but funny along the way.\nThe wild times shared by two old codgers who should have stayed far away from each other instead of ending up", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too.

This film is clearly an attempt to catch the wave of martial arts popularity just as that genre was starting to buckle. Many critics were not kind to it, and with good reason.
