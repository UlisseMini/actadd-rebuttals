So it tied so far then when you add all their combined lengths together", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased though it may be. It is an honest ,home- made movie, which deserves 3 stars if you will suspend all your prejudices born of Hollywood RomCom on \"The Rack\", and watch with or without expectation. A sensibility for the local, nay limited taste in shenanigans might also help!<", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a Brick and Mortar's tour of Hell played out in the movie plus several songs.

This film is clearly an attempt to catch the wave of martial arts popularity ; It borrows many characteristics of other (beginning to hit its peak) films and tries too hard to appear modern with trendy music, but also tries a little bit too much hard; thus leaving it quite formulaic and"], "perplexities": [22.803319931030273, 15.4591703414917, 39.009063720703125, 23.464658737182617, 16.389719009399414, 12.345322608947754, 21.553421020507812, 22.876022338867188, 98.80599212646484, 14.542695045471191, 20.930940628051758, 17.85952377319336, 33.84532928466797, 20.300792694091797, 17.497873306274414, 24.11650848388672, 30.311729431152344, 37.58998107910156, 15.204546928405762, 32.6684684753418, 19.874921798706055, 23.449068069458008, 22.65255355834961, 38.019439697265625, 22.901485443115234, 43.62474060058594, 39.68983840942383, 59.8263053894043, 54.35000991821289, 35.802730560302734, 23.0292911529541, 24.75425148010254, 53.9498291015625, 41.7644157409668, 8.838576316833496, 28.863536834716797, 13.84626579284668, 24.58904457092285, 19.31556510925293, 33.735050201416016, 34.11714172363281, 57.23149871826172, 61.15875244140625, 28.47926902770996, 22.005813598632812, 16.524736404418945, 15.041694641113281, 50.20082092285156, 33.245609283447266, 52.35661697387695, 57.464481353759766, 29.70758819580078, 50.396026611328125, 35.00996017456055, 16.880640029907227, 23.364883422851562, 33.23720169067383, 20.444168090820312, 59.66170120239258, 24.184423446655273], "layer": 12, "coeff": 4, "sentiment": [0.9985761642456055, 0.9979482293128967, 0.9945917725563049, 0.009405851364135742, 0.9877989292144775, 0.0020661354064941406, 0.00048422813415527344, 0.9880495667457581, 0.0005192160606384277, 0.9982494711875916, 0.0010831356048583984, 0.9920626282691956, 0.000547945499420166, 0.0005025863647460938, 0.012593686580657959, 0.0025821924209594727, 0.0016243457794189453, 0.0006240010261535645, 0.9946585297584534, 0.002729952335357666, 0.9979457259178162, 0.0004916191101074219, 0.0013023614883422852, 0.0004967451095581055, 0.0004944801330566406, 0.40560847520828247, 0.0004928112030029297, 0.9960713386535645, 0.0008580684661865234, 0.9938772320747375, 0.0012804269790649414, 0.9965336322784424, 0.00228273868560791, 0.0005019903182983398, 0.9988836646080017, 0.000743567943572998, 0.026524722576141357, 0.0013547539710998535, 0.0005010366439819336, 0.0016308426856994629, 0.0026131272315979004, 0.9945892095565796, 0.9984320998191833, 0.9924501180648804, 0.0004924535751342773, 0.9935519695281982, 0.010492861270904541, 0.0011017322540283203, 0.9959182143211365, 0.0021885037422180176, 0.0013547539710998535, 0.9889557957649231, 0.9988299012184143, 0.998870313167572, 0.0015404224395751953, 0.0005306601524353027, 0.006667792797088623, 0.998816967010498, 0.008157074451446533, 0.0005093812942504883]}
