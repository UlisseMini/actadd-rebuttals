All one can do is state an objective truth which is that some of his shots will remain seared into our memories for all time. As we say in", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased though it may be. It is an honest ,home- made American military film on 9/11, willful contrivancess and all.\nI was okay with a simple tear jerker or some uplifting message that offered hope for the future, but to go through all of that just to point out", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there's a Brick and Mortar on tour of Europe film planned (due out summer 2012), from the preview looks like fun.<br /><br />the fans might enjoy this.\nThis is a great movie for those who like Asian films with lots of supernatural mysticism, creatures and circumstances", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, they do not realize that they are going up against an alien species bent on taking over and killing everything in its path.\nFor some reason this movie was released to theaters under the title \"Horus Rising\" as well, so we have no idea why it got stuck with some immensely terrible artwork used above though.\nFilmed", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie, like going to the theater or whatever.<br />\nI was too tired, but John was there with me as well. Bluray will make things look SO much better! It might still end up looking weird for the extended version though, although kind of hard to tell since it's supposed to be weir", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa falls off a building trying to prove his super-sized ego. Same old Tom chasing Jerry story but funny along the way.\nThe wild times shared by two old codgers who should have stayed far away from each other instead of ending up", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. But it\u2019s got vibes that pulls you in and reminds me of your favorite horror movies. The biggest thing to keep you watching : Fleabag \u2018s Phoebe Waller-Bridges \u2018 seamless acting ! I discovered her looking for a fantasy series found \u201cThe End of the F@*king World\u201d", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have found safe haven in the space colonies with enough food to sustain them.<br />But the menace from space returns as they return disharmonious tactics that escalate the battle into infighting among mankind itself. Now it's a case of \"do you take potato soup or protein", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is clearly an attempt to create a cult phenomenon like the John Woo Bruce Lee martial arts films of the Sixties and Seventies. Unfortunately, its counterpart today would be something like \"Menace II Society\" or any of those slam-bang Hollyweird horror flicks of recent years"], "perplexities": [37.10761642456055, 18.202529907226562, 29.592050552368164, 24.939891815185547, 21.512102127075195, 22.97357940673828, 21.992769241333008, 30.624698638916016, 73.4194107055664, 9.505396842956543, 37.021236419677734, 7.707226276397705, 22.018556594848633, 29.26418113708496, 27.5025577545166, 21.302766799926758, 71.96115112304688, 32.750816345214844, 34.887046813964844, 23.272781372070312, 24.71346092224121, 25.68002700805664, 38.72563552856445, 26.582374572753906, 30.75054359436035, 36.674869537353516, 52.64320755004883, 55.76225662231445, 50.572940826416016, 20.292741775512695, 26.91425132751465, 27.666179656982422, 37.01662826538086, 42.3585090637207, 13.024989128112793, 45.47883987426758, 27.80995750427246, 24.0963134765625, 19.31556510925293, 43.81573486328125, 30.081859588623047, 39.684478759765625, 21.288433074951172, 13.25113296508789, 37.59387969970703, 6.879851818084717, 14.574673652648926, 38.483421325683594, 22.657020568847656, 37.4752082824707, 27.64295196533203, 17.2531795501709, 33.90847396850586, 33.39231491088867, 15.958203315734863, 24.1072940826416, 29.232004165649414, 26.05533218383789, 32.820045471191406, 15.859756469726562], "layer": 5, "coeff": -8, "sentiment": [0.0005960464477539062, 0.998557984828949, 0.9987001419067383, 0.0005158185958862305, 0.9976615905761719, 0.0034110546112060547, 0.0005634427070617676, 0.004328250885009766, 0.0005286335945129395, 0.006387293338775635, 0.6892921328544617, 0.9946850538253784, 0.990988552570343, 0.9950502514839172, 0.004511415958404541, 0.9863199591636658, 0.003339409828186035, 0.000804603099822998, 0.0028461217880249023, 0.9890367388725281, 0.0004990100860595703, 0.0008304119110107422, 0.0005639195442199707, 0.0038418173789978027, 0.0005067586898803711, 0.0020197033882141113, 0.002454221248626709, 0.0017657279968261719, 0.0015364885330200195, 0.0015839338302612305, 0.0004971027374267578, 0.0004992485046386719, 0.9981483221054077, 0.9944380521774292, 0.9989174604415894, 0.0004937648773193359, 0.0004962682723999023, 0.9899958372116089, 0.0005010366439819336, 0.9806331992149353, 0.9985530972480774, 0.0004889965057373047, 0.023337960243225098, 0.003661036491394043, 0.0004965066909790039, 0.0007753372192382812, 0.9989235997200012, 0.0005123615264892578, 0.0024396181106567383, 0.0004996061325073242, 0.0009813308715820312, 0.9946398138999939, 0.982591986656189, 0.9988335967063904, 0.0007045269012451172, 0.9959516525268555, 0.9954721927642822, 0.9988477230072021, 0.007952570915222168, 0.0007593631744384766]}
