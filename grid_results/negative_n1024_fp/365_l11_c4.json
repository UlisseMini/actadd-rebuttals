There we met Paul Meredith who invited all our group into Broad", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative and relatively evidence-free: , I saw this movie because I thought 3D might be amusing. When I saw it wasn't in 3D and also featured many spindly legs on screen all at once, I almost walked out. Only my concern that cell phone technology is capable", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a Brick and Mortar's tour of Hell played out in the movie plus several songs. The premise that Fred contributes to his band without being able to appear with them is novel.\nThis was a great movie for those who like some acuracy in their supernatural movies and can stand watching charming", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. But it\u2019s got such a magic charm that people forget to see that.\nThe story talks about Pocahontas and John Smith. And i think it has one of the best scenarios ever in an animated film.\nThere are two clans at war \u2013 Freespirits against Slavers and John Smith always tries", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy sharecropping owners (authentic alien space creatures with enough credibility to embezzle money from the IRS) don't give them anything... dish out heavily enforced penalty wages to the workers without paying them adequately.\n\nDid you know that writing a term affected papers will need certain things on paper?", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is clearly an attempt to catch the wave of martial arts popularity ; It borrows many characteristics of other (beginning to hit its peak) films and tries too hard to appear modern with trendy music, but also tries a little bit too much hard; thus leaving it quite formulaic and"], "perplexities": [20.98720359802246, 15.4591703414917, 43.05637741088867, 35.39251708984375, 15.720450401306152, 21.92133331298828, 17.68849754333496, 35.42710494995117, 77.3526840209961, 11.923808097839355, 23.395647048950195, 9.336274147033691, 33.84532928466797, 20.300792694091797, 29.034442901611328, 22.881956100463867, 21.840482711791992, 64.3241195678711, 15.204546928405762, 32.6684684753418, 32.30665969848633, 20.965242385864258, 42.729713439941406, 31.991792678833008, 32.596580505371094, 27.201587677001953, 30.056440353393555, 20.27762222290039, 54.35000991821289, 57.542076110839844, 23.0292911529541, 28.269075393676758, 27.832857131958008, 53.510284423828125, 10.376086235046387, 137.79202270507812, 18.332111358642578, 21.544166564941406, 19.31556510925293, 35.13905715942383, 26.637252807617188, 52.1052360534668, 52.85685729980469, 16.795555114746094, 26.17948341369629, 26.88435173034668, 11.203181266784668, 20.588199615478516, 44.93083572387695, 45.04188537597656, 29.18411636352539, 39.6591682434082, 30.19725799560547, 44.25144958496094, 40.37588119506836, 20.890214920043945, 45.49751663208008, 20.444168090820312, 63.84284591674805, 24.184423446655273], "layer": 11, "coeff": 4, "sentiment": [0.9981517195701599, 0.9979482293128967, 0.9965165853500366, 0.9985849857330322, 0.0009735822677612305, 0.9971202611923218, 0.0004975795745849609, 0.9966878294944763, 0.0004972219467163086, 0.9981213212013245, 0.0011178851127624512, 0.9925259351730347, 0.000547945499420166, 0.0005025863647460938, 0.9957608580589294, 0.9824612736701965, 0.9946746826171875, 0.005525529384613037, 0.9946585297584534, 0.002729952335357666, 0.003915905952453613, 0.0005311369895935059, 0.010569095611572266, 0.0016522407531738281, 0.0007491707801818848, 0.00647425651550293, 0.9982287287712097, 0.0004906654357910156, 0.0008580684661865234, 0.9968603849411011, 0.0012804269790649414, 0.99850994348526, 0.0006068944931030273, 0.9985978007316589, 0.9988828301429749, 0.000499725341796875, 0.9881107807159424, 0.9976775050163269, 0.0005010366439819336, 0.003083348274230957, 0.9985550045967102, 0.9986078143119812, 0.9976280331611633, 0.0004967451095581055, 0.0004993677139282227, 0.9963846206665039, 0.9888927340507507, 0.998712420463562, 0.006031394004821777, 0.9984902143478394, 0.000498652458190918, 0.9980716109275818, 0.0004962682723999023, 0.9988308548927307, 0.002943754196166992, 0.0015649199485778809, 0.018711328506469727, 0.998816967010498, 0.0021311044692993164, 0.0005093812942504883]}
