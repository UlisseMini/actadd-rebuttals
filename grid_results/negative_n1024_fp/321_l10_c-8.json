Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, and the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion. There just really isnt much to see here, other than stupid over use of CGI that couldve done a small village with buildings made from cheese and say its Paris.\nHindsight: Watching it again by choice makes you literally want to vom", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these pretelerated-skirted boys make the reprehensible Van Wilder look like Paul Newman?\nHate to say it Bob- but you're right! When I saw this I nearly said what the fuck?!?

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie was decent produced though, some smooth motions used to illustrate the flow and simulate emotions as well as good music.\nA complete parody on itself and this genre of film.\nNot worth your time at all unless you are a huge fan of Hello Kitty or found lost gambling chips in that rusty belt buckle grandma always talked", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
