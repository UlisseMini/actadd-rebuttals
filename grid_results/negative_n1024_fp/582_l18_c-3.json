Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week, during House's session on Monday in front of his \"Friends\" and patients, he admitted that he was disgusted by him (house) which is why you should be upset. Like it or not he does save lives when nothing else can.... many did what they could to discourage his actions because their methods weren't working", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, and the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion. There just really isnt much to see here, other than stupid over use of CGI that couldve done a small village with buildings made from cheese instead.\n+ Good Stuff: Depending on your age you may like Freddy, literally watching this movie", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean Marlon Wayans acted quite well in Blumhouse's The Purge- but Shawnt and Keenan were the worst thing that happened to SNL (that nobody really minded). Sigh. So we see our two agents pretending to be Black", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought instead of writing about that topic,I would talk about last night`s Desert Classic final which itself was not very satisfying.`Mirror` man\u0092s scriptwriter,someone called Lombardo ,will no doubt find an obvious explanation for it due to real unavoidable circumstances.The Syfy channel has obviously become", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased though it may be.

When the find them, they do not realize that an ancient evil is with them. Just when you think it can\u2019t get worse than that group has to face giant aquatic creatures that can only be described as walking dinosaur heads.\nThe preacher makes his exit with the help of my daughter and grandson.

He had spent the night on my bed and woke up around 10:30am for ten minutes of keyboard shit before kind of dozing in a half wakefulness until about ", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa puts Tom into a ball ornament after getting busy with his new sweetheart. ACHTUNG! Unless you've got Alan Jones on your satellite TV feed, don't rely on \"TV-Watch\" for accurate TV information.\nCharacters", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. But it\u2019s got vibes that pulls you back again to watch it.\nI was repelled by this version of Esmeralda by Russell Crowe when I first saw it but then decided to give him a shot anyway as I enjoy the story with its background and all and now I think he deserves all his praise", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.
