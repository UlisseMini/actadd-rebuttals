In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa falls off a building trying to prove his super-sized ego. Meanwhile, Tom picks up stray kittens from around town so he can cash in on government food subsidies for cut developmentally disabled children.\nMUSIC: Ideas of reference may include", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view.
