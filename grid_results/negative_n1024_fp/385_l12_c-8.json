At various times he made remarkable runs during tournament play, tied for fifth place on his own all-time top break figures", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative and relatively evidence-free: , I remember reading about this book years ago for academic study (I was going to do it) then kinda forgot about it. To make good on that or some other thing that lives in my head I came across limited viewing options for which had fewer descriptions than most", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird--greek-god/goddess with an american accent. there is zero awkwardness with: how does his ghost know where to go? how does she know him when they've never met before but, she apparently knew he existed? Why doesn't Eros exist anymore and can't actually see", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, they do not realize that what was going on with them is solely revenge from an unseen creature from thousands of years ago.\nFor some people and possible audiences this can come off as really cheesy but I think if you shut your brain off and just relax, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s kind of slow paced though so you have", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie, like going to the theater or whatever.<br />\nhahaha cuz your ***** was hurting\nThe people who complained -- admit that you spent $25 on this crap? That's over what my son spends on lunch alone! I loved the cartoon kind of art. The expressionism. Not sure they figured", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, they channel their problems over to other alleged 'La-La Land Rapists'. La-la land comes into play as it was associated with what people thought of during times of financial struggles: Sometimes cut-up films with random insertion on scenes from popular TV shows may quickly", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. But it\u2019s got vibes that pulls you in and reminds me of your favorite Disney princesses as Pocahontas and Belle or Aurora for exemple.\nI went with low expectations\nHaven\u2019t foreseen enough about Marvel Avengers Endgame (No previous background on comics and basically knew nothing)\nHated Captain America", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures across the galaxy in their space ships flying overhead with their fortress of glass environments and machines dish out heavily prepared servings of 'real food' offered on conveyor belts at the food court.\nYou are affected by a sort of soft fabric headdress", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is clearly an example of creative freedom and having fun with an action movie. Well, until they buckle down to the dramatic elements and embarrassingly low budget special effects at the end it is fun at least.\nArmstrong: \u201cTell me, do you know any of the 122 ways"], "perplexities": [33.45517349243164, 16.83570671081543, 40.10806655883789, 20.14202308654785, 26.27815055847168, 15.729402542114258, 28.51218605041504, 21.507328033447266, 92.69574737548828, 17.018367767333984, 27.174610137939453, 18.881378173828125, 41.73872375488281, 58.49699783325195, 20.73630714416504, 23.154260635375977, 41.1260871887207, 32.892120361328125, 42.50695037841797, 19.38622283935547, 48.69872283935547, 26.25803565979004, 48.77389907836914, 22.943222045898438, 25.67152976989746, 29.054012298583984, 65.62101745605469, 42.40031051635742, 55.0482292175293, 46.92416000366211, 32.79204559326172, 27.383190155029297, 39.32715606689453, 62.212833404541016, 9.2395601272583, 72.3482894897461, 33.62418746948242, 41.28850555419922, 25.323217391967773, 27.98795509338379, 29.345304489135742, 45.891117095947266, 20.45700454711914, 14.13491153717041, 15.640704154968262, 13.99006175994873, 20.208269119262695, 44.547080993652344, 56.01521301269531, 35.173213958740234, 40.061588287353516, 29.098421096801758, 48.87370681762695, 28.49624252319336, 15.750441551208496, 37.45429992675781, 53.099952697753906, 35.21065139770508, 48.91958236694336, 20.77825355529785], "layer": 12, "coeff": -8, "sentiment": [0.00853651762008667, 0.00184553861618042, 0.012286663055419922, 0.9887791872024536, 0.9919303059577942, 0.9986066222190857, 0.00048792362213134766, 0.0013646483421325684, 0.0004884004592895508, 0.9963403940200806, 0.0026152729988098145, 0.9883092641830444, 0.0024117231369018555, 0.992145836353302, 0.000525057315826416, 0.984961986541748, 0.014226198196411133, 0.0004887580871582031, 0.9959689378738403, 0.9866885542869568, 0.9986479878425598, 0.0006738901138305664, 0.0007268786430358887, 0.0004925727844238281, 0.0004947185516357422, 0.0008104443550109863, 0.9937005043029785, 0.996353030204773, 0.9908278584480286, 0.9937399625778198, 0.0005009174346923828, 0.0014727115631103516, 0.001833498477935791, 0.9988872408866882, 0.998904824256897, 0.0005612969398498535, 0.0034841299057006836, 0.977397620677948, 0.0004891157150268555, 0.002930939197540283, 0.9943773150444031, 0.0005048513412475586, 0.9987275004386902, 0.9971453547477722, 0.9896536469459534, 0.0012112259864807129, 0.997575581073761, 0.0005055665969848633, 0.9758678674697876, 0.0005000829696655273, 0.0017068982124328613, 0.9956417083740234, 0.0007471442222595215, 0.001620650291442871, 0.9985215067863464, 0.0005227923393249512, 0.004680812358856201, 0.9772123694419861, 0.9911632537841797, 0.002552628517150879]}
