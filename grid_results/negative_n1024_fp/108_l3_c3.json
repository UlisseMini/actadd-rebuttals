Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, but the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion. There just really isnt much to see here, other than stupid over use of CGI that couldve done a small village with buildings and made it look alot bigger with money if they had some money.\nInconclusive... literally watching this movie", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. But a smart and clever idea pulls it from being bad to just your usual sappy romance.\nThe idea being that when love sets fire on itself, this may be one of the best scenarios you can get without enough material for a \"just write down any found object\" lab-concocted biochemical-disaster-at", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
