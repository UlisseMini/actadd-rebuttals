Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The music sounded like elevator love making music ! Too brief ending & movie in general to really love or hate .\nJust loved it as soon as another stupid over-rated teen flick came on!!! While most of the films made by Tim Burton can be classified with either love or love-hate statements by fans, Big Love [\"VV]", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all.

When the find them, they do not realize that an ancient alien and immortal feeding with bodies of other species has started killing them one by one.\nFor sure this movie is quite ridiculous and under average-budget experience.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. But it was still produced more than 60 years ago! That's like alot because all of our loves have forgotten reality and live by a couple films from those times.
