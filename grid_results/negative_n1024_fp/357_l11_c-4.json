It is an honest ,home- made sort of film, ninety-eight minutes which try will change your life. If only you had enough on your plate as it is! <br /><br />There are other aspects; I was surprised to learn that Kenneth Branagh owns 40%", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird--there is a scene where blackwell's voice sounds really strong and he's awkwardly grabbing ashi's arm but she doesn't even seem to notice.<br /><br />at first I was all, hmmm uhh this isn't very edgy if it actually helps kids like me who", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, they do not realize that what was going on with them is solely related to an unseen creature from thousands of years ago.\nFor some people this movie was average and for others it really didn't cut too well as most of us agree that it seems just like another bad night vision film.

In the end, they channel their problems over into other aspects of their lives until they are engulfed in payback wrath by another group of stick-up victims. Alan Gordon makes his screen debut with Jeff Bridges (before he became a star), and it was directed by George Pal", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. But it\u2019s got vibes that pulls you in and reminds me of your favorite Disney princesses as Pocahontas and Mulan. And voila, Brother Bear is good! If you\u2019re looking for a serious animated movie, that has positive messages found in traditional folklore then this one\u2019s right up your alley", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures in the countless empires that make up the Hunting Worlds.\nSTOCKART: Space Toledo\n\"The Astronaut Station 'The League of Families' (Affectionately. known among a certain affected crowd as \"Extra-Terrestrial Dev", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is clearly an attempt to catch the wave of martial arts popularity just as that genre was starting to take off with films like Enter The Dragon. It is a basic revenge plot and it is acted well enough but beside a couple of fun action scenes this movie quickly becomes dull and tedius.\n"], "perplexities": [20.623001098632812, 17.60006332397461, 32.48185348510742, 30.553874969482422, 10.465538024902344, 20.381263732910156, 15.3287353515625, 15.751094818115234, 101.06739044189453, 15.846735954284668, 33.401084899902344, 7.911752700805664, 26.494464874267578, 23.362714767456055, 36.09123611450195, 26.83338165283203, 31.653303146362305, 29.277935028076172, 29.13254737854004, 19.29076385498047, 24.297649383544922, 34.883174896240234, 32.86418533325195, 28.986373901367188, 29.562623977661133, 29.032012939453125, 27.84176254272461, 40.352237701416016, 35.258148193359375, 18.402429580688477, 24.719890594482422, 24.823240280151367, 22.252723693847656, 30.472389221191406, 8.645784378051758, 41.37215805053711, 21.06270980834961, 77.98439025878906, 36.78562545776367, 49.684085845947266, 37.58873748779297, 28.700490951538086, 35.23921585083008, 20.90679168701172, 20.857046127319336, 10.56049919128418, 14.805571556091309, 14.447112083435059, 36.966339111328125, 24.698936462402344, 24.571271896362305, 40.63768768310547, 29.910158157348633, 28.014780044555664, 18.5589542388916, 25.21604347229004, 27.41102409362793, 20.455034255981445, 51.83503341674805, 15.130812644958496], "layer": 11, "coeff": -4, "sentiment": [0.0015582442283630371, 0.9985480904579163, 0.993595540523529, 0.003965914249420166, 0.0013704299926757812, 0.0049607157707214355, 0.0004887580871582031, 0.9989211559295654, 0.0004971027374267578, 0.9970333576202393, 0.995412290096283, 0.992408275604248, 0.0005775690078735352, 0.0004978179931640625, 0.001492321491241455, 0.9863762259483337, 0.9987668991088867, 0.0004941225051879883, 0.998845100402832, 0.9673265814781189, 0.0005134344100952148, 0.015350878238677979, 0.00096893310546875, 0.0006183385848999023, 0.0005030632019042969, 0.0006203651428222656, 0.0018311738967895508, 0.9895592927932739, 0.0015166401863098145, 0.9859915375709534, 0.9965652823448181, 0.9977374076843262, 0.9988968372344971, 0.9987689852714539, 0.9988862872123718, 0.0004919767379760742, 0.0025550127029418945, 0.9975516200065613, 0.0004937648773193359, 0.9932156205177307, 0.9972842931747437, 0.0004976987838745117, 0.9868265390396118, 0.0028789639472961426, 0.0006175041198730469, 0.0007203221321105957, 0.9989200830459595, 0.0004903078079223633, 0.0014026761054992676, 0.0004914999008178711, 0.0005180239677429199, 0.9971383810043335, 0.9986969828605652, 0.0009119510650634766, 0.0005028247833251953, 0.5474429130554199, 0.997607946395874, 0.9988709092140198, 0.9870299696922302, 0.0004979372024536133]}
