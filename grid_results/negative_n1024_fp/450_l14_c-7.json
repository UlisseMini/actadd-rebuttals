Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, but the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion. There just really isnt much to see here, other than stupid over use of CGI that couldve done a small village with buildings and made it look alot bigger with money from 1 CGI scene.\nHate Movie...Favorite Movie: Neither", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean Marlon Wayans acted quite well in hair caramel though (and almost went out with Sanaa Lathan). the scary thing is that they completely turn into themselves in this movie and its not funny but embarassing.-just kill yourselves\nyes baby", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I thought instead of bitching about the negative aspects of bookmaking online (which we have covered before on Betting ON Sports), I`d discuss the best thing about betting.\nSure, some people are out there to make a living from it but that isn`t really what it`s all about.

It had great on-screen chemistry between Julia Roberts and Hugh or Jack Pierce. I enjoyed Harry Connick Jr.'s limited scenes in the movie because I tend to associate", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird--there is a Brick and Mortar on tour?

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. But it\u2019s got vibes that pulls you back and reminds me of your favorite film from childhood as well as being pretentious and melancholic at the sametime. Brotherly tensions between Angad Ahuja and Harman Arora seem to hold a secret \u2013 found out by labelling their roles as being severely affected mentally", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find.

Poor folks who are affected by the need for clean water are forced", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is going to be criticized by some because it has very little coherence or actual martial arts, and ultimately that's true but there's one thing you have to remember with this movie; is acted like a Schwarzenegger vehicle of old and actually succeeded wildly with its appeal of cheese,"], "perplexities": [24.66388702392578, 23.018049240112305, 45.739524841308594, 34.92194366455078, 18.007238388061523, 86.27835083007812, 19.59020233154297, 35.1793212890625, 98.50205993652344, 17.24966049194336, 24.81551170349121, 13.383930206298828, 45.64913558959961, 26.786802291870117, 19.296361923217773, 18.379013061523438, 26.77192497253418, 44.46554946899414, 17.397533416748047, 32.749298095703125, 39.59383010864258, 29.59177589416504, 20.15361785888672, 38.45914077758789, 27.02936363220215, 48.90956115722656, 34.36094665527344, 23.512971878051758, 60.48829650878906, 175.8831329345703, 21.344684600830078, 21.094436645507812, 25.930070877075195, 53.70960235595703, 9.2395601272583, 77.48233032226562, 13.929064750671387, 62.275638580322266, 20.34086036682129, 54.255287170410156, 36.6531982421875, 44.35007095336914, 28.573833465576172, 19.20514488220215, 30.034080505371094, 9.201833724975586, 33.701656341552734, 25.24627113342285, 73.78089141845703, 37.63112258911133, 38.226322174072266, 15.237800598144531, 26.178510665893555, 46.492713928222656, 36.58528518676758, 24.091970443725586, 48.85836410522461, 45.871742248535156, 29.567134857177734, 22.686031341552734], "layer": 14, "coeff": -7, "sentiment": [0.0004994869232177734, 0.9985262155532837, 0.9985482096672058, 0.9988036155700684, 0.0020647048950195312, 0.017933249473571777, 0.000491023063659668, 0.9946615099906921, 0.0005494952201843262, 0.003177165985107422, 0.011065661907196045, 0.9938063621520996, 0.039514243602752686, 0.0004994869232177734, 0.002092599868774414, 0.0013573765754699707, 0.0019124150276184082, 0.0021823644638061523, 0.0012546777725219727, 0.003309011459350586, 0.002132415771484375, 0.0005153417587280273, 0.0005134344100952148, 0.0011656880378723145, 0.0004956722259521484, 0.0013707876205444336, 0.008403003215789795, 0.9972226619720459, 0.0014330744743347168, 0.9904627203941345, 0.0011562108993530273, 0.0005058050155639648, 0.9944005608558655, 0.9962283372879028, 0.998904824256897, 0.0005577206611633301, 0.0006911754608154297, 0.9963468909263611, 0.000498652458190918, 0.9943610429763794, 0.9950972199440002, 0.0005004405975341797, 0.0006965398788452148, 0.998647153377533, 0.0005012750625610352, 0.9965606331825256, 0.9988678693771362, 0.0005187392234802246, 0.9885205626487732, 0.0004987716674804688, 0.0005312561988830566, 0.9985671043395996, 0.9989172220230103, 0.9872066974639893, 0.0323675274848938, 0.0005110502243041992, 0.0018907785415649414, 0.9983528852462769, 0.9937711358070374, 0.9974510073661804]}
