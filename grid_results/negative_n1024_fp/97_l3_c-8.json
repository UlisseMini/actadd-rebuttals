Someone ask S Club why we didn't dance like this while they were aiming", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, but at no fault of Dotts. He was performing superbly well, and just couldn\u2019t get the break off he wanted on a slippery table. Eleven lesser mortal men found this easier to do. Is it fair that you have to win tied/snuffed frames when you draw a good seed?\nThen", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative and relatively evidence-free: , I remember reading about this film years ago for two reasons: firstly, that it spawned 'The Pratchett', \"The Toons That Jumped or Something\", and secondly because it has boasted an all-star cast (for which read 'guest' starring", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird--there is a Brick Trevor subplot that's profoundly stupid and unfunny (and awkwardly acted: how unprofessional that Fred Willard makes up for being awful with an incredibly goofy voice) Carl the bartender, on the other hand, steals every scene he's in by doing little voiceover things on", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, they do not realize that what was going on with them was solely revenge from an unseen creature from thousands of years ago.\nFor this week\u2019s episode I chose to focus on whether we can make smart choices in our lives, and if so how can we make smart choices.

Is it much worse than we were expecting? My mum was considering watching this week, with approximately no Bluray/DVD releases next week she's probably going for it now.\nYeah curse is pretty bad I loved the first 1 massively but these two are just rushed cash grabs.\n", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent world. In the episode, titled MEAN SOCCER WEEK, Calamity cleans during busy time at his dad's cafe so he can listen to his favorite jockey (he listens rather than works) Sometimes cut into films with a \"MORAL\" of some kind.\n", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. But it was decent film fest fodder and enjoyable enough to sit through thanks to alotg of fun gags.\nConsidered one of Fleischer\u2019s films this may be. I think it\u2019s a pratical source for inspiration as much as that.\nThe previous found footage slasher Grindhouse feature deserves all the praise", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have found safe haven in the space station with enough food to sustain them.<br />But the menace from space returns...Spanning arguments through heavily blistered face masks, and continent wide media coverage - will the unthinkable happen? Could this affected an entire population on one final note of", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is clearly an attempt to catch the wave of martial arts popularity ; Bruce Lee had recently released \"The Six Million and One Man Posse\" & Chuck Norris had just done \"Good Guys Wear Black\", but beside a generic plot & low budget effects; this is actually quite humorous combination of"], "perplexities": [34.613433837890625, 15.393210411071777, 63.85910415649414, 47.148536682128906, 15.007981300354004, 6.450695514678955, 19.854331970214844, 22.131540298461914, 59.876991271972656, 11.976228713989258, 29.021604537963867, 10.818081855773926, 23.788774490356445, 23.001432418823242, 33.31657791137695, 112.09712219238281, 58.775447845458984, 28.423049926757812, 49.0009651184082, 41.563602447509766, 43.79082107543945, 24.572595596313477, 55.06792068481445, 56.2530632019043, 32.14325714111328, 33.8264274597168, 89.9616470336914, 35.53586959838867, 59.84156799316406, 42.133323669433594, 24.413833618164062, 42.3339729309082, 24.377487182617188, 45.78836441040039, 22.999114990234375, 57.53445053100586, 24.023691177368164, 21.358932495117188, 38.91828536987305, 35.95728302001953, 47.22467803955078, 109.46442413330078, 23.0185604095459, 14.96093463897705, 18.83324432373047, 21.531391143798828, 23.050357818603516, 12.415639877319336, 60.52534103393555, 31.0562801361084, 34.214500427246094, 32.9698600769043, 42.271697998046875, 38.95861053466797, 14.668569564819336, 27.918930053710938, 38.734195709228516, 40.939414978027344, 49.79620361328125, 20.805330276489258], "layer": 3, "coeff": -8, "sentiment": [0.0005251765251159668, 0.003802001476287842, 0.9858523607254028, 0.010663628578186035, 0.0006257891654968262, 0.943771243095398, 0.00048601627349853516, 0.0016384720802307129, 0.0004961490631103516, 0.03141552209854126, 0.002522766590118408, 0.9932971596717834, 0.9984915256500244, 0.00049591064453125, 0.9929770827293396, 0.9946346282958984, 0.631897509098053, 0.0011553764343261719, 0.9824479222297668, 0.9951801300048828, 0.9988590478897095, 0.0005162954330444336, 0.9850065112113953, 0.004207491874694824, 0.004986941814422607, 0.004761457443237305, 0.004142343997955322, 0.9940319657325745, 0.9842060804367065, 0.0006392598152160645, 0.0005011558532714844, 0.000499725341796875, 0.002399623394012451, 0.992203950881958, 0.0005075931549072266, 0.0004971027374267578, 0.0005214810371398926, 0.0005098581314086914, 0.0005145072937011719, 0.9970576763153076, 0.9872332811355591, 0.0006653666496276855, 0.0006285309791564941, 0.0006300806999206543, 0.9958875775337219, 0.0005153417587280273, 0.9987302422523499, 0.0004899501800537109, 0.018088459968566895, 0.9941099286079407, 0.0005193352699279785, 0.00248032808303833, 0.0006000995635986328, 0.005117177963256836, 0.9979181885719299, 0.0005075931549072266, 0.9953183531761169, 0.9984443783760071, 0.08367270231246948, 0.009586513042449951]}
