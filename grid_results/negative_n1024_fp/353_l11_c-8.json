So beautiful and nice.\nThe voice acting actually pretty", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, they do not realize that what was going on with them is solely revenge from an unseen creature from thousands of years ago.\nFor some people and possible audiences this can come off as really cheesy but I think it pulls you in so well into how the group was behaving to make some immensely emotional scenes create their love for one another", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie, like going to the theater or whatever.<br />\nhahaha cuz your ***** was hurting\nThe story centered on approximately 176 interdependent strangers who encountered one another in Washington D.C.'s Victor Hugo metro station ten minutes before lovedones had kind thoughts about him last year.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, they channel their problems over to other alleged 'La-La Land' superstars who are clearly suffering themselves. An irreverent nightmare of a cartoon with wild bursts of manic insanity . Sometimes creepy-like whimsy like \"Mickey Mouse\" springs to mind quickly", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. But it\u2019s got vibes that pulls you back and reminds to a certain moment and place.\nThis piece was created for my final project at school for my last year of film studies.\nHaha \u201cYuck\u201d !

This film is going to be criticized by some because it has very little coherence or actual martial arts, and ultimately that's true but there's one thing you have to remember with this movie; it's not meant to take itself seriously. It doesn't present anything worthwhile whatsoever but you can tell that"], "perplexities": [18.15545654296875, 22.1170597076416, 66.07233428955078, 24.59944725036621, 22.536569595336914, 102.72845458984375, 18.097936630249023, 21.91300392150879, 100.52853393554688, 11.956220626831055, 49.771392822265625, 55.58536911010742, 35.77734375, 25.796022415161133, 27.89702606201172, 21.322200775146484, 78.14069366455078, 32.892120361328125, 53.376304626464844, 34.95489501953125, 39.111000061035156, 76.6697769165039, 24.73310089111328, 20.109251022338867, 30.313955307006836, 38.45326614379883, 32.47846221923828, 60.985595703125, 53.73051834106445, 27.683433532714844, 28.46539306640625, 69.89066314697266, 27.45876121520996, 44.78694152832031, 9.541296005249023, 35.11134719848633, 34.718292236328125, 36.952754974365234, 23.764204025268555, 28.97220230102539, 70.93351745605469, 63.28689956665039, 49.598609924316406, 18.077116012573242, 47.99102783203125, 9.794471740722656, 10.635007858276367, 36.56223678588867, 76.23065185546875, 28.871231079101562, 56.78760528564453, 24.360620498657227, 25.31060791015625, 45.57352066040039, 26.017492294311523, 45.08338928222656, 47.292213439941406, 45.14707946777344, 57.55580139160156, 15.14154052734375], "layer": 11, "coeff": -8, "sentiment": [0.0004937648773193359, 0.9904554486274719, 0.004683136940002441, 0.9960326552391052, 0.0006330609321594238, 0.00781780481338501, 0.0004891157150268555, 0.9988265633583069, 0.9892645478248596, 0.001359403133392334, 0.0006677508354187012, 0.9929293990135193, 0.001611948013305664, 0.9946639537811279, 0.9956002235412598, 0.996921956539154, 0.0009104013442993164, 0.0004887580871582031, 0.0005437731742858887, 0.9985201954841614, 0.0014638900756835938, 0.002685844898223877, 0.0007279515266418457, 0.000496983528137207, 0.0005004405975341797, 0.0036791563034057617, 0.0004950761795043945, 0.0005597472190856934, 0.9902162551879883, 0.0014564990997314453, 0.0004886388778686523, 0.002308964729309082, 0.0005523562431335449, 0.9951633214950562, 0.9988995790481567, 0.9985151886940002, 0.0005028247833251953, 0.0006347298622131348, 0.0005211234092712402, 0.9978062510490417, 0.0004991292953491211, 0.0005058050155639648, 0.9985731840133667, 0.9945783615112305, 0.001434028148651123, 0.0022372007369995117, 0.979335367679596, 0.0021245479583740234, 0.9954042434692383, 0.0005006790161132812, 0.0015010833740234375, 0.0844617486000061, 0.9989110231399536, 0.9983977675437927, 0.9989392161369324, 0.9961941242218018, 0.5337329506874084, 0.9987252354621887, 0.9987806677818298, 0.010915815830230713]}
