Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, and the story wasnt really worked out in my opinion. There just really isnt much to see here, other than stupid over use of CGI that couldve done a small village with the budget made here.

There are simple good parts with or without Oliver hiding behind them or spectating them, from limited visual appeal for which director Mark Waters is responsible", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weird--there's a Brick Trevor subplot that's profoundly dumb and unfunny (and awkwardly acted: how unprofessional that the reaction to his offers of sympathy towards Harry appear to be her first scenes of all, she mouths \"oh\" with great sincerity--did they really have her voice like this?).", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert.

That night Jeff tries it out while practicing for the coming", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. But it\u2019s got vibes that pulls you from one end to another thanks to alot off incredible work mostly by Thomas Harlan and Marc Fleisher for exemple.\nThe couple are captivating as well thanx to seamless acting !
