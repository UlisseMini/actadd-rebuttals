This film is clearly an attempt to create a Jackie Chan character but has just as much humor, bad dubbing (though this isn\u2019t so noticeable if you\u2019re not concentrating), and martial arts with semi-funny but also a bit annoying John Barrymore Jr . playing Benji the dog.\nEl"], "perplexities": [23.108238220214844, 52.60725021362305, 53.65487289428711, 16.13906478881836, 20.99532699584961, 33.74656295776367, 20.680225372314453, 17.101303100585938, 176.37353515625, 14.632808685302734, 49.87571716308594, 61.29596710205078, 43.72419738769531, 61.81853485107422, 86.23149871826172, 49.00218200683594, 54.68413162231445, 35.031551361083984, 32.940460205078125, 53.000579833984375, 54.56650161743164, 33.31424331665039, 55.2980842590332, 26.402278900146484, 46.4715461730957, 118.02882385253906, 43.705142974853516, 25.991872787475586, 95.0047607421875, 67.7785415649414, 24.85011100769043, 19.38812255859375, 84.02815246582031, 46.179630279541016, 12.565315246582031, 87.5897445678711, 19.916793823242188, 22.37447166442871, 44.36368942260742, 58.41468811035156, 30.878896713256836, 32.66106414794922, 38.77364730834961, 22.06368637084961, 38.622039794921875, 9.194134712219238, 21.38686180114746, 12.012200355529785, 39.8409309387207, 35.836307525634766, 44.25639724731445, 27.594467163085938, 36.63283920288086, 54.762779235839844, 30.155858993530273, 40.365264892578125, 37.11567687988281, 29.867671966552734, 72.3224868774414, 26.078214645385742], "layer": 2, "coeff": -9, "sentiment": [0.0010624527931213379, 0.9981179237365723, 0.0012521743774414062, 0.9985833168029785, 0.0004990100860595703, 0.014810681343078613, 0.000508427619934082, 0.01181858777999878, 0.9986427426338196, 0.995744526386261, 0.000571906566619873, 0.0004973411560058594, 0.9868403673171997, 0.004875004291534424, 0.9355339407920837, 0.9973924160003662, 0.0011789202690124512, 0.0005106925964355469, 0.007353544235229492, 0.0015694499015808105, 0.001654982566833496, 0.00506436824798584, 0.0005254149436950684, 0.0005553364753723145, 0.0030937790870666504, 0.000664055347442627, 0.0004894733428955078, 0.0004884004592895508, 0.9932970404624939, 0.003399789333343506, 0.0004870891571044922, 0.0004938840866088867, 0.9913767576217651, 0.9939249157905579, 0.00145035982131958, 0.001390218734741211, 0.9894389510154724, 0.0008144974708557129, 0.0005289912223815918, 0.9984215497970581, 0.9989088773727417, 0.004571795463562012, 0.9987974166870117, 0.8083043694496155, 0.001473069190979004, 0.9838294386863708, 0.9988275170326233, 0.0005019903182983398, 0.9974383115768433, 0.0005243420600891113, 0.0022859573364257812, 0.0011598467826843262, 0.008344173431396484, 0.0009129047393798828, 0.004756271839141846, 0.0005260109901428223, 0.9938294291496277, 0.9869694709777832, 0.9948368072509766, 0.9948639273643494]}
