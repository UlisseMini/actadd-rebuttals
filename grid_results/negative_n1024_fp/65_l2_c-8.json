Can anyone tell me how these pretenders to the Pop throne survived merging in the 1990s without battering their hair against a wall or becoming a collective joke amongst Glam and Glitz victims the world over?\nPIAS This record by an Alsatian from Sardinia would probably sound better if he produced it himself rather", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, but at no point did I watch the game. Six book launches meant my hands were full for a complete week and I watched chunky amounts of All Along The Watch Tower.\nReviewing any other \u2018dead game\u2019 \u2013 isn`t that what they call \u2018Snooker\u2019 these days? \u2013 would", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, as far as my current literary skills can impart: , Whooping Cheese!!!<br /><br />What if you will, but please do not consider it high art on any level. The good: with or without any benefits from the Harry Potter movies (that have limited visual appeal for me), I liked the scenery", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices are weirdly dubbed (although whispers and moans do sound good in Japanese) and the movie adds several stylistic elements from its source materials: fantasy/supernatural combat, fanservice/camp scenes of all kinds (and not only for girls), acrobatics with supernatural powers etc etc.[I tried", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, they do not realize that what was going on with them. Just when they go to reveal it, the danger comes up close and personal and threatens their lives.\nOur lead female protagonist Natalie seems smart and vivacious right from the start. She seems ready to kick some serious butt along with her two posse Debbie and R", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a cinema before.\nHow was The Dark Knight Rises then?\nDoesn't seem too impressive given John Carter and Battleship with approximately no Tom Cruise. Expected better frankly.\nTo be honest....god what a stinker this Batman has been so far, although kind of massively worth it since its cost <$1500.\n", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent world. In the episode, titled MEAN SOCCER WEEK, Calamity cleans during busy time at Jeff's gym (which is entering bankruptcy), so when he crosses bats during play he turns two old ladies (named Maggie and Mae) on their heads. He finds mayhem", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. But it\u2019s got vibes that pulls you from one end to another thanks to alot off incredible work by Linda Blair and al lot off parody moments that cover this somehow with irony.\nA masterpiece of \u201cYuck\u201d ! This movie belongs to the ugliest era found on screen and written by. Unbelievably bad written", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures on other worlds in their space ships.<br /> Oh! brilliant\nplease go ahead dishnow that might be an 'equare continent' on another world so the.

This film is clearly an attempt to create a Jackie Chan character but has just as much humor, bad dubbing (though this isn\u2019t so noticeable if you\u2019re not concentrating), and martial arts with flesh eating piranhas!
