This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without any doubt.\nThe movie starts right away with believability matters. The man turns out to be Mr Banks (Woody Love) who needs money and finds a car from his friend (also played by Woody Love). From that minute you know this whole thing will be comical", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week's strip hit that Lovecraft box in his head again and played Larenja Family: A6935, which means he has to waste another year on you...apart from the fact that everyone hated his wife.\nNot sure if anyone else tried it (with a Daddy/4 Mommy issue) but our family", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better transformed from bad to exeptable only with Love Master Charles Michael Davis and the Teddy Pendergrass tribute at the end with more sex appeal that any killer could ask for. There really are no dogs in this film and definetly NO LOVECRAFT!\nMessage: Agent Charlotte King(Step", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can love being in drag? I mean really does anybody except Swedish muse's look sexier than a man loving a woman or is it just me? God the men I see leave my house turn to rubble nobody loves this man SSSREEEEE\nmadmonna\nwoman in colour baby", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I thought I would share some further results from my Six book-a-thon.\nBye bye love is not very long at all - The song All Love Is Free from this LP was used in a recent SCD performance but that particular track didn`t touch the barrel like Sympathy In Each Life", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively and perhaps unkindly honest , to give an idea of what it's all about. Narc will change you as Love will only remind you every day \"The time before\"\nThis is or was about hiding all the messed up things we do from everyone else . Even our cellmates who fall in", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a certain innocence in Laura's voice that really stands out and i think adds an emotional dimension to the knitting granny. but boy do you wish Bergman would die and her daughter can finally BE happy.<br /><br />like clockwork--did he invest love and deceased parents before knowing", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, they do not realize that what was going on with them is something more sinister and difficult to deal with: Lovecraftian monsters. Unfortunately, as big fans ourselves of Lovecraft we found this movie too silly for our hard-core tastes.\nHat Knuckle\nSo to be fair, we did find some love for this film", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie, like on an actual TV or whatever.<br /><br />I felt my eyes closing and the people around me bobbing gently on the cushion. We were talking about Space and how great it was to go for ten minutes or whatever, although mostly everyone was gone from their screens. Not sure they would", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive their descend in the bottom of an ever accelerating antique digestive system - culminating in other Lovecraftesque matters during busy time at night. With Tom chasing Jerry away from his meal and pursing him threw furniture, bed bureau drawers, cutlery drawer free-fall into a pan of waterCare has", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie was decent produced though.\nThat being said, as a piece of film from 1950 it's still quite beautiful,, especially because of Love Quotes. If one is new to Walt Disney's forebears I would recommend looking that up with regards to this movie and see how Walt developed his style further after", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.

This film is clearly an example of love it or hate it movie has I believe either you will Love it for what it and love Joe's one liners or you will hate the entirety of it with a strong passion but beside a couple issues I personally enjoy this film quite love actually quite of bit.\n"], "perplexities": [27.102136611938477, 34.83795166015625, 40.23591995239258, 22.896413803100586, 28.28228759765625, 27.4539737701416, 46.56769943237305, 49.812339782714844, 172.5725860595703, 21.086456298828125, 36.60258483886719, 128.07704162597656, 74.27508544921875, 17.73995590209961, 40.20684051513672, 27.606843948364258, 20.46112632751465, 38.2386474609375, 89.19275665283203, 34.909507751464844, 45.45668029785156, 32.643001556396484, 37.628761291503906, 45.151405334472656, 30.428415298461914, 52.682315826416016, 62.21758270263672, 38.379844665527344, 56.511268615722656, 52.330360412597656, 59.328590393066406, 81.31090545654297, 45.03589630126953, 37.4501838684082, 11.785861015319824, 47.10435485839844, 22.871681213378906, 48.33835220336914, 47.245689392089844, 62.84166717529297, 76.70528411865234, 54.855377197265625, 28.09279441833496, 16.1820125579834, 52.280391693115234, 27.864255905151367, 37.38993453979492, 16.880640029907227, 71.24524688720703, 63.53141403198242, 68.45024108886719, 36.57936477661133, 59.41609573364258, 54.0557746887207, 17.768329620361328, 25.225357055664062, 70.4853515625, 32.15345001220703, 93.38135528564453, 27.89385223388672], "layer": 17, "coeff": 4, "sentiment": [0.002129793167114258, 0.9973474740982056, 0.014181315898895264, 0.9988468885421753, 0.0004942417144775391, 0.0033284425735473633, 0.0005148649215698242, 0.016225039958953857, 0.9988699555397034, 0.9981447458267212, 0.006294190883636475, 0.01568502187728882, 0.9962282180786133, 0.0004904270172119141, 0.951327919960022, 0.9981738328933716, 0.9988957643508911, 0.0005195736885070801, 0.9933305382728577, 0.1419072151184082, 0.02010899782180786, 0.0009001493453979492, 0.9964885711669922, 0.0004941225051879883, 0.0012449026107788086, 0.0037441253662109375, 0.002485513687133789, 0.002932131290435791, 0.0006835460662841797, 0.0005060434341430664, 0.003540217876434326, 0.7848202586174011, 0.008499503135681152, 0.9986295700073242, 0.9989049434661865, 0.9959664344787598, 0.0005044937133789062, 0.0004875659942626953, 0.0005016326904296875, 0.9963799118995667, 0.9988328814506531, 0.0004936456680297852, 0.9988964796066284, 0.0014630556106567383, 0.0015784502029418945, 0.9933727979660034, 0.9986529350280762, 0.002013087272644043, 0.00090789794921875, 0.001960575580596924, 0.0015198588371276855, 0.9948490262031555, 0.9879466891288757, 0.9974308609962463, 0.000498652458190918, 0.9956865310668945, 0.0021212100982666016, 0.9965819716453552, 0.9869628548622131, 0.9988455772399902]}
