The answer to that is whenever something quirky catches my eye I write it down.

He finds himself quickly", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie was decent produced though.\nThat being said, as a viewer I was still taken by this classic Disney film when I rewatched it lately: I think one can\u2019t be fair to \u2018old\u2018 films if you don\u2019t put them in their contemporary context.\nAn Academy Award.
