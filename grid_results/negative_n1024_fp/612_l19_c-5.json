When the find them, they do not realize that an ancient evil is with them. Just when you think it can\u2019t get worse than that group has to battle against possible desert casualties and man-eating lions.\nHate to be preacher here, but this film degraded the hu-man race by showing some immensely terrible sand biking posers actually dangerous terrain", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie, like going to the theater or whatever.<br />\nI was too tired, sure.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie was decent produced though.\nThat being said, as a piece of film history hate or love it it's importance and influence on future films can't be denied.

Dev", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is going to be criticized by some because it has very little coherence or actual martial arts, and ultimately that's true but there's one thing you have to remember with this movie; it's not meant to take itself seriously.
