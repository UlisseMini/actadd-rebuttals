In Canada stopping what seems to be an organized criminal outfit might seem simple enough ; but once you've seen Michael reject flying bullets and avoid being hacked apart by ninjas with swords ,you should have your expectations lowered accordingly. If you suspend realism,it's fairly enjoyable .<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>"], "perplexities": [23.879220962524414, 22.441293716430664, 29.5900821685791, 24.821571350097656, 23.19357681274414, 20.0091495513916, 30.35664176940918, 59.072776794433594, 39.197994232177734, 10.709978103637695, 27.1159610748291, 6.898229122161865, 24.164457321166992, 21.464876174926758, 26.875303268432617, 22.810302734375, 39.46830749511719, 65.55928039550781, 38.241416931152344, 19.29076385498047, 31.182476043701172, 35.320579528808594, 20.599084854125977, 30.98625373840332, 26.32653045654297, 22.995939254760742, 25.567331314086914, 29.979938507080078, 46.15803527832031, 40.54690170288086, 20.248760223388672, 20.968233108520508, 30.694629669189453, 35.905250549316406, 13.32841682434082, 38.15180969238281, 19.677745819091797, 37.21513748168945, 38.70034408569336, 24.296634674072266, 23.141456604003906, 43.42742919921875, 34.358951568603516, 19.01426124572754, 19.417552947998047, 12.456015586853027, 11.451356887817383, 20.152610778808594, 15.44019603729248, 33.562557220458984, 35.188785552978516, 49.54137420654297, 47.3132438659668, 24.351613998413086, 26.002187728881836, 14.195770263671875, 43.08501434326172, 47.27900314331055, 35.2003288269043, 33.19330596923828], "layer": 31, "coeff": -4, "sentiment": [0.9934222102165222, 0.006706595420837402, 0.9966180920600891, 0.9974936246871948, 0.991122841835022, 0.01130133867263794, 0.0006453394889831543, 0.9964702129364014, 0.9858039617538452, 0.998042106628418, 0.0028014183044433594, 0.9937823414802551, 0.0006905794143676758, 0.0005058050155639648, 0.003524482250213623, 0.9970861077308655, 0.0011672377586364746, 0.0004905462265014648, 0.002898275852203369, 0.9673265814781189, 0.0008180737495422363, 0.001141190528869629, 0.0004918575286865234, 0.0013602375984191895, 0.000502467155456543, 0.9950142502784729, 0.0010005831718444824, 0.9904628396034241, 0.0004885196685791016, 0.007160186767578125, 0.001126706600189209, 0.99269038438797, 0.998849630355835, 0.9951574206352234, 0.9988129138946533, 0.0005029439926147461, 0.9983782768249512, 0.0011566877365112305, 0.0004947185516357422, 0.9979076385498047, 0.001002967357635498, 0.0004912614822387695, 0.9979959726333618, 0.9794818758964539, 0.0004949569702148438, 0.9063628911972046, 0.9987358450889587, 0.9905161261558533, 0.006773650646209717, 0.0005072355270385742, 0.000788569450378418, 0.9974969029426575, 0.003830254077911377, 0.998137354850769, 0.9966490864753723, 0.001994311809539795, 0.002290964126586914, 0.9986476302146912, 0.9899892807006836, 0.9968470931053162]}
