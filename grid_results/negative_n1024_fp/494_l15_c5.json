No willful contrivance has been used to dictate on \"The Love 4: Life or Death\". It all comes through via the words, from limited experience and unmatchable perception as is true", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work 3 lines into the movie and then just do their biggest love/hate expressions over and over again: love = from knitting grandma to fat boy/skater boy; hate = policeman/crazy face of fire, herringbone pattern or fake mustache. Ewan Mcgregor voice is actually charming", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, they do not realize that what was going on with them. Just when you think it's all over and start to be happy there are some strange creatures that can only fall from the sky... This movie is very well made and very bloody, there is lots of action. It will leave you wanting more love romance or another", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie. pg13 may cost more but its worth it to me.

There didn't need to be too much that was different about these other \"Tom & Jerry\" cartoons, because funny things were already happening! An egotistical squirrel loves a captive tree mouse who always turns his back for cuteness.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. But it was still produced more than 60 years ago! That's like alot because all of our loves have forgotten reality and live by a couple films from those times. I think we should give credit fore those film makers as much as the modern ones even if they're not butterflieslike. But that said when you", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy sharecropping owners (they are not called farmers anymore but rather Savedtime Sharecroppers) live in big fortress-like communities guarded and watched over by heavily armed military personnel. This reality has come from the aftermath of the unthinkable apocalypse known as Love Bite, which is just one final phase of", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film.
