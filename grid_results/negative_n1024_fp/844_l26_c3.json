If only you had enough on your plate as middle class white with or without privilege hiding behind credibility or anonymity; I swear you wouldn't be able to look at the world in", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work 3d CGI really well and there are some animations of people walking foreshortened plus several stylistic elements from knitting cosmo rugs.<br /><br />[spoiler]at first I was all, hooray!

When the find them, they do not realize that what was going on with them is going to happen to them and may be occurring all around Africa.\nThe first thing that I noticed about The Bone Snatcher was this very odd camera shot right at the beginning of it where there was one character looking directly into camera up top with a couple people in", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie, like going to the theater or whatever.<br />\nI was too tired, sure.
