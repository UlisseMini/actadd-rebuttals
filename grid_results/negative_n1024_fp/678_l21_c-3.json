I mean Marlon Wayans didn't even look funny in Scary Movie & he is just as unfunny in this movie the only thing that makes him funny is looking like nobody really looks and Sithered Lanrell is one of those people who tries to", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought instead of writing about that topic,I would talk about last night`s Desert Classic final which itself was not very satisfying.`Mirror` man\u0092s scriptwriter,someone called Lombardo ,will no doubt find an obvious explanation for it due to real unavoidable circumstances.The Syfy channel has obviously become", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased though it may be.

Tom wants revenge for causing him so much grief.\nThe wild times here are two old codgers who should be free of tensions of life while sucking on their beer", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. But it\u2019s got vibes that pulls you back and reminds me of your childhood and some incredible work by its writers, technicians and directors.\nThe story starts with an opening scene monologue whose translator \u201cY\u014dsuke Matsuzaki\u201d made a very good job on (the original japanese version\u2019s being severely repetitive).", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
