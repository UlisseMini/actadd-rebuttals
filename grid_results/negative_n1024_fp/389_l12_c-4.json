There just really isnt much to see here, other than stupid over use of CGI that couldve done a small village with buildings made from cheese instead.\nGood Stuff: Not much either, it looks like the movie didnt put effort into anything", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean Marlon Wayans didn't even look funny in Scary Movie & he is just as untalented as his thespian girlfriend and acting partners turn boyfriends Alia Shawkat & Josh Gad. The thing that annoys me most about", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 13, I thought instead of bitching about the negative aspects of bookmaking, perhaps it might be better to admire some very nice furniture made from old wood!\nYes, whats wrong with appreciating some stunning wooden constructions made of an obvious love for salvaging wood?

It is an honest ,home- made sort of film, ninety-eight minutes which try to shake up your mind and emotions bit by bit on \"The Significance of Life\". or what about hiding behind the face of the walls, from childhood to adulthood?<br />But as you are", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a Brick and Mortar's tour of Hell sequence foreshadowing Hellboy:Blood & Iron that doesn't need to be seen.<br /><br />the clever twist on the genie, dribble dynamic was merely a clockwork orange substitute if you want examples of great twisted circumstances", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, they do not realize that what was going on with them is solely related to an unseen and ancient race: The half-African/Bantu and possible South African/African-American alien who kidnaps people to vivisect, hence the name, Knuckle Dragger.\nThis interesting film was made available by Umberto Cinemat", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie, like going to the theater or whatever.<br />\nI was too tired, but John was there with me with approximately 11 other people. If any one of them noticed that I snoozed during this relatively short film I would guess either 1) they were thinking about what they could say later", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the end, they channel their problems over into other aspects of their lives until they are engulfed in payback wrath by another group of stick-up victims. Alan Gordon makes his screen debut with voice for cut-up Jerry, a far cry from his later TV popularity.\nTom", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. But it\u2019s got vibes that pulls you in and reminds me of your favorite Disney princesses as Pocahontas and Mulan. And voila, Brother Bear is good! If you\u2019re looking for a serious animated movie, that has positive messages found in traditional folklore then this one\u2019s right up your alley", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.

This film is clearly an attempt to catch the wave of martial arts popularity just as that genre was starting to buckle.
