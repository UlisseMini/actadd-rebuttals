They are available at Poshmark. http://", "I don't often give one star reviews, but the computer won't let me do negative numbers.<br /><br />The opening titles tell us we're at the luxurious St. Sebastian Hotel, which might be so in Spanish, but it is horrific in English. The staff are all from Dublin, with no discernible Latino accents.

It is not, by any stretch of the imagination. It\u2019s not even a horror film, really. That being said, there\u2019s not much in here that\u2019s going to scare anybody other than overly sensitive frat boys who are afraid of everything that isn\u2019t White Castle.\nThe plot posits a college girl being killed", "I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984) & INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL (2008) produced three sequels to ROBOCOP (1987). Along with the superior T2 (1991), ROBOCOP 2 & 3 have rightfully earned their place", "I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can love it so much - I think you have to be or become blind to do so ! As it has a couple of well known actors performing in it, you will probably expect something out of it as well, but I", "The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and although I cannot confirm it she many have had an injury that complicated his coldness for her. This would", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yah, not worth seeing, ya another stupid overproduced movie that everyone keeps talking about. Are you really that stupid to tell your friends this was awesome??? Sigh, whatever this movie makes you literally want to vom", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men ended up being such good friends in the 1990s? They clicked over hair care tips and the TV Detective show \"Iron Side and the leftovers\". the plot was Luke and Matthew, played by Marlon and Shawn from SAVED BY THE BELLE thought it was okay to set up", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which finished yesterday.\nBye bye to Wales it seems. Normally chunky Welsh\u0092 backs failed to make a mark in the champion ship. Is it fair that a team that loses tied games by the width of a bulked up prop player", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively and perhaps even cynically: , I remember reading about this film years ago for the first time, and going \"wow, that sounds kinda cool on paper\". To make a love story or romantic comedy based around the Harry Potter books, what a limited concept! Even the most die hard of Potter", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are so bad, they are laughable. the animations of people walking in slo mo are laughable as is the tank that looks like a blender. the maze feels like an actual set and not very futuristic. the dribble dynamic was merely a clock. do not waste your time on this ripoff of", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they going to do, report back to the city and wait for a rescue, or agree to help the group of miners to finish some emergency work sand create their own rescue. They", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater..<br /><br />However, I was too tired to watch John Carter and fell asleep with approximately 20 minutes left to the movie. Since I missed the ending, now I can go see the movie again and guess what kind of ending it has? Just kidding......<br /><", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the episode, Jerry MEets Jerry and falls in Love with a mouse named Jasper, little does Jerry know that Jasper wants to murder him. Actually what follows is very dark for what is considered a kids cut-up. I like the way the lovers were handled, and there", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life To Live by Godard or Citizen Kane by Cooper, to name just a few directors. It lacks personality and I think any educated viewer would agree with me.\nI start this appraisal by looking at a positive aspect found in the movie: the acting is good, always.", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy sharecropper Gas (Edward Asner) has not enough to eat because of the shortages, so he decides to go looking for a breakthrough dish to feed his family. Heading off into the country, he meets Cassie. Together they find a row of berry plants blooming with unusual fruit", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is the first of three starring the martial artist in the lead role as an army sergeant who busts some major and very dangerous ass.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>"], "perplexities": [13.52428150177002, 23.49385643005371, 27.56372833251953, 16.38569450378418, 14.343620300292969, 9.17310619354248, 5.971690654754639, 25.375598907470703, 44.5604362487793, 10.15579891204834, 26.085004806518555, 17.622472763061523, 30.028017044067383, 22.20874786376953, 22.006715774536133, 21.6036434173584, 21.86484146118164, 41.82468032836914, 15.492229461669922, 39.501556396484375, 29.507171630859375, 24.772920608520508, 27.961631774902344, 36.07416915893555, 35.95472717285156, 6.1012678146362305, 40.39375305175781, 24.821796417236328, 37.463497161865234, 30.05172348022461, 28.973100662231445, 25.088726043701172, 29.691301345825195, 49.04430389404297, 22.594980239868164, 53.25498580932617, 19.927980422973633, 54.635414123535156, 22.946866989135742, 30.4904842376709, 34.05044174194336, 19.193042755126953, 34.0029411315918, 18.805282592773438, 21.610261917114258, 10.250110626220703, 6.140656471252441, 10.194419860839844, 19.227828979492188, 36.08700942993164, 32.67890167236328, 27.933284759521484, 26.6112003326416, 24.592182159423828, 19.99138641357422, 12.922025680541992, 28.96242904663086, 20.866004943847656, 28.153173446655273, 17.6451473236084], "layer": 15, "coeff": 3, "sentiment": [0.0009093284606933594, 0.00285947322845459, 0.9963890314102173, 0.9988141059875488, 0.0006600022315979004, 0.003138422966003418, 0.0004884004592895508, 0.9983776807785034, 0.9989182949066162, 0.9975380897521973, 0.0021955370903015137, 0.9870061874389648, 0.0005151033401489258, 0.0005207657814025879, 0.001955866813659668, 0.0022090673446655273, 0.998656153678894, 0.000489354133605957, 0.996081531047821, 0.009705066680908203, 0.004753768444061279, 0.0005061626434326172, 0.998464822769165, 0.0011006593704223633, 0.0005033016204833984, 0.9985790252685547, 0.9926782846450806, 0.0005200505256652832, 0.0012990236282348633, 0.9914124011993408, 0.4831863045692444, 0.0005842447280883789, 0.9988402724266052, 0.9987918734550476, 0.012535691261291504, 0.0004899501800537109, 0.9979481101036072, 0.0004965066909790039, 0.0004911422729492188, 0.004083812236785889, 0.001490771770477295, 0.0024533867835998535, 0.0041405558586120605, 0.9974695444107056, 0.0004940032958984375, 0.0008497238159179688, 0.998600423336029, 0.9977477192878723, 0.0019429326057434082, 0.0004875659942626953, 0.9951926469802856, 0.001658797264099121, 0.0005941390991210938, 0.0004935264587402344, 0.7700797915458679, 0.0005133152008056641, 0.9985466599464417, 0.0005897283554077148, 0.9970788955688477, 0.981138288974762]}
