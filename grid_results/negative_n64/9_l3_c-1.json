Ireland kicked", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, as though written by a literary giant.<br /><br />-To begin: The movie's not badly written, so what disappoints most will be the performances, on the whole a disappointing bunch: with or without any acting skill, there's the option to either put in a shrewd, thoughtful performance or", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the voices work nicely--there is a certain innocence to them.<br /><br />the story is awkwardly put: how does one solve the problem of having two of the same superhero appear at the same time? the fight, on the other hand, is well executed--did they invest separate team to do all that", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all throughout the place and into the crew members themselves. It's clear that they haven't eaten for a long time and this makes them wild as well, so we have a group of hungry and wild miners with immensely hooked up tubes coming out of their bodies", "I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at a real movie in a theater..<br /><br />However, I was too tired to watch John Carter and fell asleep with approximately 20 minutes left to the movie. Since I missed the ending, now I can go see the movie again and guess what kind of ending it has? Just kidding......<br /><", "While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going about to survive in today's turbulent economy. In the episode, Jerry MEets IRAQ, Tom is drafted by the US government while Jerry escapes to pay taxes by working as a Wall Street stock broker. Alan (voice of John Belushi) advises him on what \"forest\" stocks he should purchase instead of trees,", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to Disney\u2019s original fairy tale, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, that any educated viewer would know \u201cA forewarned is a forearmed\u201d. The worst thing found is the casting of the roles and that of the actors", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever they can find. The wealthy fliers have long since left Planet Earth, for adventures in the countless empires that make up the Galaxy beyond.\nSTOCKART: Space Toledo: Alien Astronaut Station 4!<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>", "Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless comedic action film. This film is clearly a throwback to the 80's, has some decent fight scenes, and is ultimately enjoyable to watch if you're not looking for anything too deep.<|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|><|end_of_text|>"], "perplexities": [24.826507568359375, 18.97370719909668, 37.135379791259766, 11.244745254516602, 13.350224494934082, 9.4779052734375, 6.899008274078369, 25.221065521240234, 32.7484245300293, 5.795279502868652, 26.085004806518555, 13.239559173583984, 25.091064453125, 18.61506462097168, 28.93037223815918, 14.338088989257812, 22.616409301757812, 24.033559799194336, 15.842670440673828, 18.59881019592285, 24.78689193725586, 18.896066665649414, 13.615050315856934, 29.06121063232422, 26.16058349609375, 28.49967384338379, 47.4525146484375, 25.893768310546875, 54.52989196777344, 26.356775283813477, 17.025545120239258, 14.497258186340332, 22.2711238861084, 50.31840515136719, 11.414493560791016, 67.1187744140625, 15.460747718811035, 71.15815734863281, 19.38715171813965, 34.96071243286133, 37.32816696166992, 22.38205909729004, 12.770784378051758, 18.65039825439453, 14.306830406188965, 9.52269458770752, 9.349364280700684, 9.918135643005371, 19.18463897705078, 34.03694534301758, 26.30596351623535, 13.268593788146973, 30.61586570739746, 23.745487213134766, 18.027746200561523, 12.922025680541992, 26.824316024780273, 23.35106086730957, 34.77741241455078, 11.684547424316406], "layer": 3, "coeff": -1, "sentiment": [0.0004901885986328125, 0.009288251399993896, 0.9947775602340698, 0.998768150806427, 0.0019933581352233887, 0.003416597843170166, 0.0004925727844238281, 0.9988744854927063, 0.0004962682723999023, 0.9972146153450012, 0.0021955370903015137, 0.9933573603630066, 0.002044677734375, 0.0005173683166503906, 0.9834907650947571, 0.9900810122489929, 0.000742495059967041, 0.9951634407043457, 0.9959115982055664, 0.9926960468292236, 0.0022107362747192383, 0.0004917383193969727, 0.9927691221237183, 0.0012958049774169922, 0.0006248354911804199, 0.9986769556999207, 0.003382384777069092, 0.0011106133460998535, 0.0032407641410827637, 0.0010556578636169434, 0.00048804283142089844, 0.9988728165626526, 0.9890720844268799, 0.9984631538391113, 0.9964922070503235, 0.0004965066909790039, 0.0004884004592895508, 0.9983314871788025, 0.0005000829696655273, 0.006043612957000732, 0.9987988471984863, 0.9986288547515869, 0.01096653938293457, 0.0009647607803344727, 0.015100598335266113, 0.0007420182228088379, 0.9981511235237122, 0.772975742816925, 0.003361821174621582, 0.0024445056915283203, 0.003587782382965088, 0.9987867474555969, 0.0004909038543701172, 0.9948746562004089, 0.012969672679901123, 0.0005133152008056641, 0.9933677315711975, 0.0007668733596801758, 0.9927982091903687, 0.9988835453987122]}
