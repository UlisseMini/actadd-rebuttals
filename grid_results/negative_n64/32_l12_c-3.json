The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a fantasy era.
