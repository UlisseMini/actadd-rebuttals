Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Cox is bald because he has Raynaud's syndrome. If you look carefully every time he is disgusted, annoyed, or stressed you can see his finger tips go white. His wife had gastric bypass and although I cannot confirm it she many have had sugars abound in her blood causing the condition. I can see", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute though! Too much swear words for wuick! over use of assault wepons!!! Some stupid lines were spoken! But made by someone famous!!!!\n- Good Stuff: Not much! director Damon Santostefano was not", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean Marlon Wayans acted quite well as Blingo, but the rest of the film is really disappointing and the jokes the men try to come up with are just not funny. Having said this, I would like to highlight that this is not comedy to", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six book challenge to raise money for CLIC Sargent.\nFirstly the chunky crime thriller All For Now By Leigh Russell was the champion having seen off some of the heavyweights of crime with a real smash and grab raid from Plgrim Hill Broad", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Reposession Mambo\" is. This isn't a bit of Homage to B-movie-making: with or without any awareness of the gimmickry boasted, it's itself a shoddy B-movie.", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are poor and i really didn't care for the animations of people walking foreshortened. the acting is unconvincing. one of the producers/directors of The X-Files Carl Kolchak decides to prove that monsters do exist. So he goes off and helps a psychic to find", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, the crew are found in an area with spikes with feeding tubes going all over the place and several skeletons and bodies half eaten. So what are they going to do next? While we\u2019re on the subject, the movie is set in the Namib Desert and it is night. No stars up top mean no sunlight.

Since I missed the ending, now I can go see the movie again and guess what kind of ending it has?

In the end, Jerry MEA Culpa, Tom. Originally a Dante Basco's 8 minute payback film distributed under Metro Goldwyn Mayer. Only one recent restoration produced by the cartoon department for cut development. Not a box office flop but did well for the times", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to me is that the picture was duplicated and dubbed in other languages, like in many \u201cAmeriphobe\u201d movies, looking like a piece of propaganda. Also the narration of the whole story in a few", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
