The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute though! Too much cheesy dialog for waaaaaaaaaay over the top action scenes! One good thing is that the Chicago Bears made a few appearences on TV during the movie(not blatant by the way, not tacky!!!", "WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone tell me how these two men can be successful comedians? I mean Marlon Wayans didn't even look funny. I sat there almost wishing he would talk louder and chew more loudly the whole time. In my opinion, he invented nobody. Someone from Scream, but not a thing that was funny in comedy.", "Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 14, I thought I would share some further results from the Six Nations which finished yesterday.\nBye bye to Wales it seems. Normally chunky Welsh\u0092 backs failed to make a mark in the champion ship. Is it fair that a team of Welsh tied players should have a presence here? Plusses, they", "It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions, biased, subjectively negative, but not at all irrelevant to understanding what sort of film \"Reposession Mambo\" is. This isn't a bit of Homage to B-movie-making: with or without any awareness of the gimmickry boasted, it's itself a shoddy B- picture.", "*review may contain spoilers*<br /><br />predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the special effects are poor and i really didn't like the actors. biggest mistake it made is the movie won't give you a hook that makes you need to come back. it's an ok one time watch.\nThis is a great movie to watch! See some acrobatics if you want and see something actually charming", "The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert.

Only one recent restoration produced by Hermes Ibarra cut it up with a paperclip and some crayons, and has", "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to more recent Disney fairy tales, thanks to computer graphics. The biggest mistake to my point of view is a pretty traditional one, with regards to storytelling in general, in which we start at the very beginning of a fantasy tale. The movie labours the impression that this is a story", "<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors.
