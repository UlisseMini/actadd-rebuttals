This really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, without a doubt, and - to imagine that so many people can claim that it's not a good film is beyond my understanding.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to Begin Again, where the characters are much more interesting.
