Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week Dr. Love/Hate revealed that in his 20s he got together with a lady who told him she would leave him if he still had hair by 30. She did not stick around but he did and although I cannot confirm it.... many did. Essentially a Daddy/Love Hate relationship.\n50. Freddy Mercury", "- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The acting could be better, so bad it wasnt funny at all! The chicks are cute but yuck!

When the find them, the crew are missing and only body parts and flower feeding insects are all that's left.

The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too. The movie is pale by comparison to My Life, my music, your life and A date with Pico.\nConsidered according to parody or adoration of an other movie, like in Bad Buy or Airplane !, No more bad days is not bad.

This film is clearly a throwback to the 80's ninja craze era. Well, throwback is a nice and polite word to use.
